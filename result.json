    "articles": "Bronze age graves, neolithic pottery and the vestiges of a mysterious C-shaped enclosure that might have been a prehistoric industrial area are among the finds unearthed by archaeologists who have carried out preliminary work on the site of the proposed new road tunnel at Stonehenge.One of the most intriguing discoveries is a unique shale object that could have been part of a staff or club found in a 4,000-year-old grave. Nearby is the resting spot of a baby buried with a small, plain beaker.Ditches that flank the C-shaped enclosure contain burnt flint, suggesting a process such as metal or leatherworking was carried out there thousands of years ago.Just south of the site of the Stonehenge visitor centre, archaeologists came upon neolithic grooved ware pottery possibly left there by the people who built the stone circle or visited it.\u201cWe\u2019ve found a lot \u2013 evidence about the people who lived in this landscape over millennia, traces of people\u2019s everyday lives and deaths, intimate things,\u201d said Matt Leivers, A303 Stonehenge consultant archaeologist at Wessex Archaeology. \u201cEvery detail lets us work out what was happening in that landscape before during and after the building of Stonehenge. Every piece brings that picture into a little more focus.\u201dThe plan to drop the A303, which passes close to the stones, into a two-mile tunnel is hugely controversial, with many experts having said that carrying out such intrusive construction work would cause disastrous harm to one of the world\u2019s most precious ancient landscapes and lead to the loss of hundreds of thousands of artefacts. A legal challenge was launched against the \u00a31.7bn plan late last year.Highways England and Wessex Archaeology, which is leading the exploration of the tunnel corridor, said they were working on the project systematically and sensitively.During this preliminary phase, Wessex experts have hand dug and sieved almost 1,800 test pits and excavated and recorded more than 400 trial trenches.The next phase of archaeological excavations will begin later this year, lasting approximately 18 months and involving up to 150 archaeologists. Construction work on the tunnel is due to start in 2023.Near the planned eastern portal of the tunnel, the archaeologists discovered large amounts of debitage \u2013 waste material from the manufacture of flint tools \u2013 and ditches that may date to the iron age and could be associated with Vespasian\u2019s Camp, a hillfort to the south.Close to the western end, two burials of Beaker people, who arrived in Britain in about 2,500BC, were found. One was an adult, buried in a crouched position with a pot or beaker. Also in the grave was a copper awl or fragment of a pin or needle and a small shale cylindrical object, of a type that is not believed to have been found before.\u201cIt is an oddity,\u201d said Leivers. More detailed work will be carried out to find out what it is, but one theory is that it could be the tip of a ceremonial wooden staff or mace.Also found in the same area was a pit dating to the age of the Beaker people containing the tiny ear bones of a child and a very simple pot \u2013 a sign that this too was a grave. Usually Beaker pots are ornate but this one is plain, probably to reflect the age of the person who diedA little farther south, the C-shaped enclosure was found. \u201cIt is a strange pattern of ditches,\u201d said Leivers. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say what it was, but we know how old it is because we found a near-complete bronze age pot in one of the ditches.\u201dAlso in the ditches was a large quantity of burnt flint. \u201cThis suggests there may have had some industrial function,\u201d said Leivers. \u201cIt could be metal or leatherworking, pottery manufacture, crop processing.\u201dAnother find was a group of objects dating to the late neolithic period \u2013 when the stone circle was built \u2013 including grooved ware pottery, a flint and red deer antlers.For the time being the finds are in storage in Salisbury and will ultimately go on display in the city\u2019s museum.The team accepts that all road schemes have an impact on an area\u2019s archaeology. Andy Crockett, A303 project director for Wessex Archaeology, said: \u201cThere isn\u2019t one option that would allow zero impact on archaeological remains; that\u2019s true of every development you can think of.\u201dHe said the trade-off was that the sight of cars and lorries trundling along the A303 close to the stones would vanish and two halves of the world heritage site now split by the road would be reunited.Highways England said the amount of survey work that had been carried out was unprecedented because of the significance of the site. David Bullock, A303 project manager for Highways England, said: \u201cThere has been a huge amount of investigations so that this route can be threaded through so as to disturb as little as possible.\u201d",

    "articles": "\u201cHas any footballer been booked or sent off for scoring a goal in a provocative or over-the-top manner (like stopping the ball on the line and nudging it in with their head)?\u201d wonders Ronan Brennan.Well, goals bring joy so why not add some decorative detail once in a while. Football is about forging memories, not just filling a history book with scorelines. Can anyone remember Rangers beating Ayr in the 2000 Scottish Cup semi-final? Nope. But we do recall the moment in that game when Andrei Kanchelskis stood on the ball before impudently raising his hand to his head to survey the penalty area. The ultimate showboat probably has to involve a goal, though, so let us begin these examples of embellishment that came with no fear of reprisal.This happened as recently as last December. \u201cSilas Wamangituka from VfB Stuttgart was booked for unsportsmanlike conduct after holding the ball on the line before scoring against Bremen, triggering much discussion in the German media,\u201d writes Mark Jameson.VfB Stuttgart's Silas Wamangituka with the savage goal of the year.Is it cheeky, or disrespectful? \ud83e\udd14https://t.co/4xiF5RlSJJ#BundesligaDiMolaTV pic.twitter.com/JmoAixBMVU\u201cAs it transpired, the great Karl-Heinz Rummenigge topped it with this cheek against Club Brugge during a pre-season tournament e in 1981.\u201dRummenigge scooped the ball up and headed it over the line to put Bayern 4-0 up in a match they eventually won 5-1. Like Wamangituka, Rummenigge was booked. Unlike Wamangituka, his effort won Goal of the Month. Yep, really.A easy goal for Karl-Heinz RUMMENIGGE (Vs Club Brugge in 1981) pic.twitter.com/86kKuKGu8ANot all referees whip out the yellow card in such situations. As far as we can tell, Patrick Kluivert was not punished for taking his time to score during the Netherlands\u2019 5-5 draw with Belgium, in 1999; nor was Paul-Georges Ntep of Rennes when he went down on all fours to head the ball over the line against Reims in 2014. But Ntep was substituted by his manager, Philippe Montainer, who later said he made the change because Ntep disrespected the opposition team.Meanwhile, Guffen Helleve has, well, a helluva story from Norway. \u201cIn a Norwegian Cup match against Mo in 1987, Bod\u00f8/Glimt\u2019s Mini Jakobsen dribbled past two defenders and the keeper, stopped the ball on the goalline and nudged it in with his head,\u201d writes Guffen. \u201cThe referee was not amused, and although he didn\u2019t book Jakobsen, he did disallow the goal for unsportsmanlike behaviour.\u201d\u201cCameroon international goalkeeper Fabrice Ondoa, 25, has played 44 times for his country, yet has only made a total of 38 league appearances,\u201d writes Alex Blackburne. \u201cIs there anyone else who has more international caps  than domestic outings?\u201dDan Robinson begins the search for anomalies with this. \u201cOne name that came straight to mind is Louie Annesley, a young defender at Blackburn. He is yet to make a league appearance for his club, and has only made three career league appearances at a senior professional level to date (while with Lincoln Red Imps in Gibraltar). Despite this, he already has 15 caps for the senior Gibraltar national team.\u201dAnd here\u2019s a right royal tale from Anubhav Dasgupta. \u201cThe one that jumps to mind here is Faiq Bolkiah. Probably the richest footballer in the world, Bolkiah is the nephew of Brunei\u2019s Sultan. He has never played a senior league game in his career, yet he has six appearances for the Brunei national team, even scoring once against Laos!\u201dAnd you thought Messi or Ronaldo topped soccer\u2019s rich list. Bolkiah had a youth career at Arsenal, Chelsea and Leicester and, despite not playing once, was apparently on the books at the King Power from 2016-20 apparently. \u201cWith Tom Cairney not getting game time, Joachim Andersen is currently captaining Fulham,\u201d writes Jim Miles. \u201cHas there ever been an occasion where a loanee was the full-time captain?\u201dPaul Moran provides a very recent example. \u201cSead Kolasinac has been made vice-captain on his loan return to Schalke this month, but due to an injury to the captain, Omar Mascarell, Kola has been the captain for each of his first three Bundesliga games.\u201dThere\u2019s more. \u201cAt PSV Eindhoven, Marco van Ginkel (on loan from Chelsea) was the captain in 2017-18,\u201d recalls Stephan Wijnen. \u201cAnd not only that: at the end of the season he lifted the championship trophy!\u201d\u201cAfter Roma\u2019s debacle, has any team ever lost a match by default after making too many substitutions before?\u201d tweets @partsublimated.Unfortunately, there are others who went to the Graham Poll school of counting.\u201cIt happened in the Bundesliga before, the 1998-99 season,\u201d remembers Ulrich Denzer. \u201cNewly promoted Kaiserslautern were hosting Bochum when Michael Schjonberg had to be taken off due to injury. Coach Otto Rehhagel substituted Pascal Ojigwe, who did not have a European pass at the time, making him ineligible due to the league\u2019s statutes (as each club was only allowed to field a certain number of such players). When Rehhagel noticed the error, he tried to correct it by having Hani Ramzi fake an injury. To no avail. The league commission ended up awarding the game to Bochum.\u201d\u201cHave they ever used an actual hat for the FA Cup draw?\u201d asked Andy Morrison in 2006. \u201cIf so, when was it last used, and what kind of hat was it?\u201dEarly draws really did involve headwear; a top hat covered by a handkerchief, to be precise. It was filled with pieces of paper bearing the names of the clubs, with a member of the FA committee delicately lifting a corner of the handkerchief to draw the ties. Bryon Butler\u2019s history of the competition is the only source of information on this arcane ritual, as until the first radio coverage of the draw in December 1935 it was \u201cbarred and bolted against all unofficial comers\u201d \u2013 including the press. By then, the bag and ball arrangement was in place. Indeed, the then FA secretary, Sir Stanley Rous, was asked by the BBC to rattle the balls in the bag for dramatic effect.David Barber, the FA\u2019s historian, suggests that the top hat and handkerchief met their demise in a drive for modernisation around 1914. Nevertheless, phrases such as \u201cin the hat for the next round\u201d will always have their roots in the actual routine of the draw.\u201cWhich football clubs have been sponsored by news organisations and have they ever played a game against another team, also sponsored by a news organisation?\u201d ponders Rich Cunningham. \u201cOr has there ever been a sort of old media v new? Newspaper v TV, or similar?\u201dQuestion for @TheKnowledge_GU and it might be hard to answer. What is the longest a tv football commentator (or commentary team) has gone without uttering a single word during a live match broadcast?\u201cAll 16 FA Cup fourth-round ties were settled in 90 minutes. Has this ever happened before?\u201d wonders Mitchell Sandler.Whilst researching the Portugese Primeira Liga during a Football Manager save, I saw the 1946/47 season averaged an astonishing 933 goals in 182 matches (5.13 per match). Even Estoril in 5th scored 96 goals in 26 games! Is this goals-per-match a record, major league or otherwise?\u201cCan you find out why the thrilling 1962 European Cup final was not televised in the UK?\u201d asks Michael Potts. \u201cI seem to remember something about a strike. Is it the only European Cup final not to be seen live in the UK?\u201dWhat\u2019s the most penalties saved by a goalkeeper in one season (not incl shootout saves)? Neil Sullivan saved at least four for Leeds in 2004-05 and Willy Gueret at least four for MK Dons in 2007-08 (in all competitions), but not sure if they or indeed anyone else has saved more?\u201cSome years ago I remember seeing a clip of a match where a fan ran on the pitch from near the goal and kicked the ball,\u201d writes Eddy Reynolds. \u201cIt may have been at Old Trafford in the 1970s at the Stretford End. Anyone know any more?\u201d\u2022 Email your questions and answers to knowledge@theguardian.com or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU.",

    "articles": "The UK\u2019s physical isolation sets it apart from its continental neighbours, but could its island status have protected it from the full horror of Covid-19, had it closed borders in early 2020, as New Zealand and Taiwan did?Both have been applauded for their efficient handling of the pandemic, with just 33 Covid-19 deaths between them. Other island nations such as Tonga, in the South Pacific Ocean, have reported no infections.\u201cTo be an island in 2020 or 2021 is probably the greatest geographical gift you could have,\u201d said Prof Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh.So, as British cases start to fall and discussions about easing lockdown restrictions resume, are there strategies it could borrow to return it to normality?From the UK\u2019s shores, New Zealand\u2019s current situation looks idyllic: \u201cAfter the lockdown(s), which were only required because border closure came too late, day-to-day life for most New Zealanders appears to be completely normal, and there are very few restrictions\u201d said Matt Boyd at Adapt Research Ltd in Reefton, New Zealand, who has modelled the impacts of border closures for island nations.Even his own pre-Covid predictions about a major loss of tourism revenues if New Zealand ever closed its borders, have not entirely come to pass. Tourist operators continue to call for emergency funding, but the economic impact has been blunted by New Zealanders holidaying domestically, Boyd said: \u201cSocially there have been family separations, people unable to return home for funerals, or see dying loved ones. But the social, economic and political consequences in New Zealand seem less than in countries dealing with ongoing community transmission.\u201dThis begs the question: would the UK now be in a similar position, had it acted earlier? The UK confirmed its first Covid-19 case on 31 January \u2013 three weeks before the virus arrived in New Zealand. \u201cLogistically it would have meant making a decision very early on,\u201d said Boyd.Yet speed is of the essence, and other countries managed it: \u201cTaiwan and Hong Kong imposed the first measures as early as 31 December. South Korea, Thailand and Japan also responded quickly,\u201d said Kelley Lee, professor of global health governance at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, Canada, whose team recently reviewed 29 studies modelling the impact of travel restrictions on Covid-19 transmission. \u201cWe found that if cross-border measures are going to work, they need to be applied early on.\u201dThe British home secretary, Priti Patel, recently said she had advocated shutting the UK\u2019s borders in March. But although a series of travel measures were introduced in 2020 \u2013 including issuing non-mandatory guidance to self-isolate for 14 days to travellers coming from designated high-risk countries \u2013 this was withdrawn on 13 March, with no further border measures in place until 8 June.Genetic analysis revealed that Sars-CoV-2 was individually introduced well over a thousand times during early 2020 \u2013 mostly from Spain, France, and Italy. \u201cLate February to mid March were critical,\u201d said Prof Oliver Pybus at the University of Oxford, who led this research. \u201cDuring this period, high numbers of incoming travellers from Europe coincided with large and growing epidemics in many European countries.\u201dThe result was multiple chains of transmission being initiated in parallel at different locations. This rapidly overwhelmed the UK\u2019s existing capacity for individual-level contact tracing. It also prevented the virus from being contained in a particular part of the country through a cordon sanitaire like in Wuhan, China. \u201cIt\u2019s likely that the importations resulted in the early phase of epidemic growth accelerating faster than was expected,\u201d said Pybus. \u201cImportations mean the virus can reach less well-connected or more remote parts of the country more quickly.\u201dThe UK\u2019s connectedness may also have put it at a disadvantage. \u201cLike France and Germany, we\u2019re kind of in that position of connecting Asia and the Americas and Africa as a pretty central point in the world, so we have a lot of people connecting through but also coming here,\u201d said Andrew Tatem, professor of spatial demography and epidemiology at the University of Southampton. \u201cThat is something that governments always have to balance up, because a lot of our service industries are based on that connectivity.\u201dEven though rapid action can buy a country time, it does not completely prevent virus from being imported \u2013 as further small outbreaks in New Zealand have shown. \u201cGovernments need to use that time to put in place and fortify domestic public health measures \u2013 notably testing and quarantine,\u201d said Lee. \u201cIt is what governments do domestically in addition to cross-border measures that has contributed to how they\u2019ve fared over the past year.\u201dIt may not be too late. Many British scientists would like to see the UK further tighten its borders and pursue a \u201czero-Covid\u201d strategy in the coming months. \u201cPeople talk about living with the virus. But what is that?\u201d said Martin McKee, a professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine.Either we try to eliminate the virus, meaning minimising travel and maintaining lockdown restrictions until there are so few cases they can be managed through contact tracing \u2013 as New Zealand has done \u2013 or ease restrictions earlier, in the hope that the vaccine will provide a solution, McKee said. It will still be many months before everyone is vaccinated, and new variants may be imported from abroad. The UK government is not convinced about the need for blanket border restrictions. It is also scrambling to book tens of thousands of hotel rooms to quarantine arrivals from 33 high-risk countries on the UK travel ban list, which are due to open on 15 February.Speaking at the Commons transport select committee on Wednesday, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said: \u201cWe are an island nation unlike \u2026 Australia or something which is an entire continent \u2013 and that means that we need to get medicines in, we need to get food in, we need to get our raw materials in, sometimes we have to move people around, scientists and others.It\u2019s true the UK is more connected than Australia or New Zealand. But Taiwan is heavily interconnected in terms of trade, and its food self-sufficiency rate is 32%, making it heavily reliant on food imports. For the UK it is about 64%.However, it is a misnomer to use the term \u201cborder closure\u201d to describe what other island nations have done. \u201cFew countries, if any, have completely closed their borders during this pandemic,\u201d said Lee. \u201cAustralia and New Zealand continue to have travellers and trade flowing into their countries. But they have reduced these to essential traffic, and they have then also introduced screening, testing and quarantine measures that ensure that anyone and anything entering their countries are virus-free.\u201cThe task, therefore, is to decide what is essential versus non-essential traffic. It is essential that food supplies, medicines and key workers, for example, continue to flow across borders. However non-essential travel should be discouraged.\u201dThe UK now faces a similar dilemma: \u201cWe have a choice here between opening up in the UK or being able to travel abroad,\u201d said Sridhar. \u201cWould you like to be able to socialise, have children at school, go to bars, watch live sports events, attend music events and get back to daily life, but at the expense of not being able to travel? Or would you like to go abroad and cross borders but live with tighter restrictions for the foreseeable future?.\u201dAsk a New Zealander which they would choose.",

    "articles": "Coronavirus has hit the UK hard, with the country recording more than 3m cases and 100,000 deaths linked to the disease.The government figures below include confirmed cases only \u2013 some people who have the disease are not tested.At the start of the pandemic, London bore the brunt of coronavirus\u2019s impact. After that, the centre of the virus shifted northwards and to areas in Northern Ireland before rising again in London and the south-east.Everyday life in the UK has been subject to varying degrees of restriction since March, and various national lockdowns currently apply in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. These regulations are set by the legislative body in each nation so there are local differences.Details of the English lockdown are listed here, Scottish lockdown here, Welsh here and Northern Irish here.Cases in the UK first peaked in early April, before falling in late spring and summer. But they then increased again and passed the earlier peak in September, reaching record levels in January.The number of people in hospital with coronavirus rose sharply after records started at the end of March, peaking in April. That figure has now been rising since September and reached a new record in January.Deaths surpassed their first-wave peak in January, with daily deaths once again standing at over 1,000.Since UK regulators approved the Pfizer vaccine in December, the UK\u2019s vaccine rollout has picked up pace. Hundreds of thousands of people are now being vaccinated every day.The government plans to offer 13.9 million people (21% of the population) a first dose of the vaccine by the middle of February. This group includes the top four priority groups: everyone in care homes, all over-70s, frontline health and social care workers and clinically extremely vulnerable individuals.There have been more recorded cases in the second wave of the pandemic, and this can be partly attributed to increased testing. Many more tests were done in autumn than during the first wave in the spring.In March and April, there were relatively few tests available and these were given to people with severe symptoms \u2013 mainly in hospitals. Most people with milder symptoms were not tested, so these cases were not recorded, meaning the actual number is likely to have been much higher. Sir Patrick Vallance said the daily case number may have been over 100,000 on some days in the first wave.More tests were available during the second wave and the majority of people took tests in the community. This means that people with milder symptoms are now being tested and recorded in the official figures. The real number of cases will still be higher than the recorded count, but the testing will be picking up a greater proportion of the total.However, given Covid-19\u2019s potential for exponential growth, the shape of the cases curve is critically important, and the effect of increased cases can be seen in the hospitalisation and mortality curves above.In the table below, you can find out the number of cases per 100,000 in your area, both for the last week and since the start of the pandemic.This data comes comes from Public Health England, working with devolved authorities in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.Differences in data collection and publishing schedules may lead to temporary inconsistencies. 3 and 4 October cases totals include cases from previous days published late owing to a technical fault.The government figures for deaths that are used in this tracker incorporate any deaths that have occurred within 28 days of a positive test. This means that they they are able to quickly capture those deaths occurring in hospitals and care homes, both settings where testing is widespread.The ONS, along with its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland, captures deaths data differently.

    "articles": "Young people are at risk of becoming unemployable and turning to crime amid partial school closures and rising joblessness, in a spiral that could lead to social unrest, the crime commissioner for England\u2019s second biggest force has warned.Covid was \u201coiling the wheels of violence\u201d, David Jamieson, the police and crime commissioner (PCC) for the West Midlands, said in an interview with the Guardian.\u201cI think we\u2019ve got a tsunami, which we\u2019re holding back at the moment. If we don\u2019t address the issues of people coming off furlough and then just having nothing they can see as their future, we are in trouble. I think it will eventually result in some sort of social unrest.\u201dJamieson added: \u201cWe\u2019ve virtually gone now a year that some children have not really experienced schooling. Some may not want to go back to school after this, and that group of people are going to go through life probably unemployable \u2026 And that group of people is going to lose it.\u201dMy colleague Jessica Murray reports.Coronavirus mutations similar to those in the UK variant could arise in cases of chronic infection, where treatment over an extended period can provide the virus multiple opportunities to evolve, scientists say. PA reports:A team led by University of Cambridge researchers observed the virus mutating in the case of an immunocompromised patient treated with convalescent plasma. They saw the emergence of a key mutation, also seen in the new variant, that led to the rapid spread of the virus before the country was forced into lockdown in January. But there is no suggestion the variant originated from this patient. However, the researchers say the effect they observed is unlikely to occur in patients with functioning immune systems. Using a synthetic version of the virus spike protein created in the lab, researchers showed that specific changes to its genetic code - the mutation seen in the B117 UK variant - made the virus twice as infectious on cells as the more common strain. As the coronavirus replicates itself, its genetic code can be mis-transcribed, leading to errors, known as mutations. Mutations that might change the structure of the spike protein, which sits on the surface of the virus, are are of particular concern. UK researchers within the Covid-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) Consortium have identified a particular variant of the virus that includes important changes that appear to make it more infectious. The health secretary said there were no current plans to roll out vaccine passports for those who had received both jabs. Pressed on the matter by broadcasters, Matt Hancock said: At the moment we have no plans for vaccine passports - and, anyway, going on holiday is illegal in this lockdown. Of course, we\u2019re constantly working with other countries and we keep these sorts of things under review, but for now there are still 31,670 people in hospital with Covid right now. It\u2019s imperative, that even with the good news on the vaccine and even with cases starting to fall, it\u2019s imperative that everybody follows the rules and stays at home unless you absolutely have to leave. I know there is good news out there but we still have very serious problems that we\u2019ve got to get through. Health secretary Matt Hancock said it was \u201ctoo early\u201d to decide whether restrictions could be partially lifted in March as the NHS is still under pressure. Asked what may be able to open in March, he told a pool of broadcast reporters on Friday:It is still too early to say that ... even though the vaccine programme is going great guns \u2013 almost 11 million people now have been vaccinated. It is still too early to say and 31,670 people in hospital with Covid as we speak right now \u2013 that is far, far too many. The NHS is still under pressure and we\u2019ve all got to do our bit to keep those case rates coming down.Hancock said the government would be \u201cvigilant\u201d about which countries would be subject to the forthcoming hotel quarantine rules. Asked whether it needed to go further and expand the current \u201cred list\u201d, the health minister said: We\u2019ll be vigilant in making sure that the hotel quarantine that we\u2019re introducing applies to the right countries where we see these new variants. We have a programme to have surveillance right across the world, working with international partners to make sure we can spot where these new variants pop up, like Brazil and South Africa that we\u2019ve seen so far, and make sure that we can keep people here safe with the new hotel quarantine. The temporary mortuary set up at Birmingham airport has reopened due to a rise in Covid-19 deaths, West Midlands police said. PA reports:The facility, which originally opened in April last year, closed in September as coronavirus deaths reduced. But the force said as infections rates have increased and hospital admissions have risen, the mortuary is reopening to take pressure off the NHS and relieve storage at hospitals. Senior coroner Louise Hunt said: \u201cOur thoughts are with all those who have lost loved ones at this difficult time. I want to stress that dignity and respect for the deceased and the bereaved continues to be our primary consideration. \u201cThe reopening of the temporary mortuary will not impact on our ability to provide the right level of service to all families and we remain focused on the humanitarian and faith needs of all those involved. \u201cWe will continue to review the need for the temporary mortuary weekly.\u201d This just in from Sky News\u2019 Aubrey Allegretti:Matt Hancock in broadcast pool confirms: \"My plan is that we should be able to offer a vaccine to everyone in categories 1-9 - that's all the over 50s - by May. \"Lots of things have got to go right to hit that goal, especially supply which is the rate-limiting factor.\"The UK reported 19,114 new cases on Friday, slightly down from yesterday\u2019s 20,634.The government announced a further 1,014 people had died from Covid-19.Yesterday, a further 915 deaths had been reported.Tributes have been made to a 29-year-old healthcare assistant who died with Covid-19 after giving birth to her fourth child. Becky Regan, who worked at North Tyneside hospital from January 2020, was remembered by family and colleagues on Friday with a one-minute silence. PA reports:In a statement, James Mackey, chief executive of Northumbria hospitals NHS trust, said: \u201cIt\u2019s with deep sadness that we mourn the loss of one of our own team who has tragically died this week. \u201cThis will be remembered as a very sad day for Northumbria and we are all devastated at the loss of our friend and colleague. Our deepest condolences are with the family at this tragic time. \u201cWhile every death during this pandemic has been a tragedy, the loss of Becky will feel especially painful having just given birth and her close family are now dealing with the worst possible news. \u201cOur thoughts are also with her close colleagues and those who treated her during her illness who will also be grieving her loss.\u201d A GoFundMe page was created by family and friends in January, while Regan was in hospital, to help her children. The fundraising page has reached over \u00a39,000. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has written to education minister Gavin Williamson to urge him to reinstate special funding for London universities worth \u00a364 million which the government has withdrawn as part of a stated commitment to rebalance education spend towards other regions. A 2019 report by KPMG for the Department for Education suggested that higher education costs 14% more to deliver in the capital. Khan stated in the letter: Your letter has let slip the government\u2019s mask on this \u2013 that the levelling up agenda is actually a front for levelling down London.Levelling up is a critical challenge within London as it is across England as a whole. Our city is grappling with deep and entrenched inequalities.Mark Harper, who chairs the Tory MP lockdown-sceptic Covid Recovery Group (CRG), said it would be \u201calmost impossible\u201d to justify keeping restrictions in place beyond 6 May, given the most vulnerable will have been vaccinated by then.The former minister said: It\u2019s great news that the local elections are going ahead on May 6 and that all over-50s will have been offered a chance to have had their all important first jab, providing the bulk of the protection against Covid, by that date too. These top nine groups account for around 99% of those that have died from Covid and about 80% of hospital admissions. It will be almost impossible to justify having any restrictions in place at all by that point. He said lockdowns and restrictions cause \u201cimmense harm to people\u2019s health and livelihoods\u201d, and that by 8 March, when the most vulnerable in the top four priority groups were likely to have a high level of immunity from their vaccinations, the government \u201cmust start easing the restrictions\u201d. He added:Given that Scotland and Wales have indicated that schools will start to open from 22 February, we need to know why English schools need to be kept shut for longer given the great news about the vaccination rollout and the impact every day outside the classroom and the playground has on children\u2019s prospects, education and social development.A further 537 people who tested positive for coronavirus have died in hospital in England, bringing the total number of confirmed deaths reported in hospitals to 74,786, NHS England said on Friday. Patients were aged between 15 and 100. All except 21, aged between 45 and 98, had known underlying health conditions. The deaths were between 17 December and 4 February, with the majority being on or after 1 February. There were 44 other deaths reported with no positive Covid-19 test result. The Oxford team said researchers in South Africa were still looking at how effective the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is against the strain first detected there, and also being spread in the UK. PA Media reports:Details of these studies will be published in due course. Mene Pangalos, executive vice-president of biopharmaceuticals research and development at AstraZeneca, said it would not be surprising to see reduced efficacy against this variant. He explained: \u201cI think it\u2019s reasonable to say that what we know from other vaccines is we\u2019re not going to be surprised to see reduced efficacy. \u201cBecause we\u2019ve seen from the J&amp;J vaccines and from the Novavax vaccines that these variants do impact - at least in mild and moderate disease, or mild disease - efficacy. \u201cI think it\u2019s to be expected there\u2019ll be reduced activity.\u201dNational Education Union (NEU) Cymru\u2019s senior Wales officer Gareth Lloyd said education minister Kirsty Williams had taken a \u201csensible approach\u201d in allowing a flexible return for pupils aged between three and seven after half term. Lloyd said: We have been clear, we believe that at least three planning days should be used after half term, with no learners in school, to give time for educators to help make the necessary plans for a safe return. Our members want a wider return in a safe working environment and we are expecting discussions next week with Welsh Government to ensure robust mitigation measures are put in place.Dilwyn Roberts-Young, general secretary of the UCAC teachers union, said: We welcome the announcement of mitigating measures to further reduce risks, including regular testing for staff and investment in equipment and modifications.However, the genuine concerns of teachers in the foundation phase about this return must be acknowledged. We urge local authorities and schools to take the local context into account in making their plans and encourage all concerned to consider a gradual, flexible return. Laura Doel, director of school leaders union NAHT Cymru, said members were \u201cbitterly disappointed\u201d the decision had been imposed \u201cwhilst there are too many questions left unanswered\u201d. She said: We have not been provided with the rationale for this decision or definitive scientific evidence to support what we consider to be the rushed and premature wider reopening of schools. More on the vaccine passports the government may not be working on rolling out currently, but potentially later, the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt said on Friday having coronavirus immunity passports was a \u201cvery sensible policy\u201d and that other countries had shown how such schemes can work\u201d. Hunt told BBC Radio 4\u2019s World At One:I think it is a very sensible policy and I know that the government is looking at how that might work.You need something that shows whether someone has had a vaccine and whether they have been tested recently. And I think other parts of the world have shown how these schemes can work quite effectively. Meanwhile, Jim McMahon, Labour\u2019s shadow transport secretary, said: Our priority at the moment must be to secure our borders against the threat of a mutation to the Covid that would undermine the vaccine. Labour will look at proposals around helping to allow people to travel safely, but this must be led by the science. A third review into the link between vitamin D and Covid has been ordered by the UK health secretary as more studies suggest that having low levels of the \u201csunshine hormone\u201d raises the risk of death.Matt Hancock has again asked the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), which sets NHS England clinical guidelines, and Public Health England (PHE) to \u201cre-review\u201d their prior appraisals, after the authorities began \u201cencouraging\u201d people to take vitamin D supplements rather than merely \u201cadvising\u201d it.Nice has twice said there was not sufficient causal evidence to support the use of vitamin D in high doses in hospitals to treat or prevent the respiratory illness.My colleague Mattha Busby reports.I\u2019m Jedidajah Otte and am now taking back over for the next few hours.

    "articles": "Downing Street has confirmed a timetable of early May for all UK adults aged 50 and older to be offered a first coronavirus vaccination, but only after it emerged in a government document that No 10 initially said was inaccurate and had been withdrawn.No 10 had previously said only that the target for offering initial vaccinations to the first nine groups of people, phase 1 of the programme, was \u201cspring\u201d, refusing repeatedly to be more precise.But a Cabinet Office document published on Friday, setting out plans to hold elections in England on 6 May, said phase 1 was expected to have been completed before then.\u201cOur public health response \u2013 not least the vaccination programme, which we plan will have reached all nine priority cohorts by May \u2013 means that we can commit to go ahead with these polls with confidence,\u201d Chloe Smith, the Cabinet Office minister responsible for elections, said in a foreword to the plans.In sometimes confusing exchanges, asked about the date at the daily briefing for political journalists the prime minister\u2019s deputy spokesperson initially said of the document: \u201cThis was issued in error, and I believe the Cabinet Office have now withdrawn this.\u201dSeveral minutes later, he corrected himself, saying: \u201cIt isn\u2019t actually being withdrawn.\u201d He then conceded: \u201cThe Cabinet Office document is correct \u2013 what it says is correct \u2013 and the prime minister will set out more details on 15 February.\u201dAsked to confirm the May date, however, he repeatedly said: \u201cAs you know, and as the PM has repeatedly said, our ambition is to offer all priority cohorts a vaccination by spring. I\u2019m not going to put a further timeline on this.\u201dThe date for phase 1 of the vaccination programme is key, as any programme for reopening the economy depends on how long it takes to offer vaccinations to the groups who are most vulnerable to coronavirus.The government\u2019s joint committee on vaccination and immunisation has published a list of groups of people who will be prioritised to receive a vaccine for Covid-19 in the UK. The list is:1 All those 80 years of age and over and health and social care workers.2 All those 75 and over.3 All those 70 and over.4 All those 65 and over.5 Adults under 65 at high at risk of serious disease and mortality from Covid-19.6 Adults under 65 at moderate risk of at risk of serious disease and mortality from Covid-19.7 All those 60 and over.8 All those 55 and over.9 All those 50 and over.10 Rest of the population.Over recent days there have been other confusing exchanges at the daily Downing Street media briefing in which reporters have attempted to pin down what ministers mean by spring.While the expected timetable for people to be offered vaccinations is of great interest to the public, Downing Street has been wary in committing to schedules beyond the target of offering first vaccinations to all older care home residents and staff by the end of January \u2013 which was largely met \u2013 and to have done the same for the first four most vulnerable groups, as far as those aged 70-plus and clinically extremely vulnerable people, by mid-February.One reason for caution is the sense inside No 10 that Boris Johnson has previously overpromised in terms of timetables for a return to more normal life.Another caveat is that while the current speed of vaccinations is sufficiently fast to meet a May deadline \u2013 more than 2.5m doses have been delivered in both of the last two weeks \u2013 this is dependent on continued supply of the two vaccines.",

    "articles": "Psychologists are reporting a rise in \u201cpandemic burnout\u201d as many people find the current phase of lockdowns harder, with an increasing number feeling worn out and unable to cope.They warn that many are finding the latest lockdown more difficult because of a realisation that coronavirus will be around longer than expected, dashed hopes about an easing of restrictions, and a period of sustained stress similar to overwork, which has prompted symptoms such as fatigue.Data also indicates people are finding it harder to stay positive, with 60% of people in the UK saying they are finding it harder to stay positive daily compared with before the pandemic \u2013 an 8-point increase from November, an Ipsos Mori survey found.Emma Kavanagh, a psychologist and author, said she had noticed more people reaching out over social media. \u201cWe are tired and have been doing this for a long time and we had this initial array of coping capacity and it\u2019s simply burnt out. When you look at burnout by definition you\u2019re talking about being too stressed for too long. There is this experience where your brain reaches capacity and goes: \u2018I cannot give the same mental attention to this any more.\u201dKavanagh has been researching extreme environments in psychology, and said: \u201cSo what you find in these extreme environments, which is a nice analogy for where we are now in terms of unpredictability and uncontrollability \u2026 is that they find something called psychological hibernation which is the same as burnout.\u201cYou see things like your concentration getting sluggish, you find it harder to pay attention and you have sleep and memory issues.\u201dBut Kavanagh said people could come out of the current situation stronger. \u201cPeople who have survived disasters have no control over it but most will exhibit post-traumatic growth, a small minority will experience long-term health effects. The vast majority will return to a baseline of function or exhibit growth.\u201dSteven Taylor, a professor and clinical psychologist at the University of British Columbia, said at the start people had little to no knowledge of what a pandemic was and then as restrictions eased there was a sense that it was almost over.\u201cThen the second wave occurred and people in many countries were back in lockdown. In technical terms, people were in a situation of \u2018frustrative non-reward\u2019. They thought they would be rewarded with an end to the pandemic, but that reward was taken away from them. Understandably, people were frustrated,\u201d he said.\u201cMore generally, the stressfulness of a pandemic is related to how long it lasts. People are exposed to chronic stressors as pandemics drag out over many months and multiple lockdowns. That wears people down.\u201dHe said pandemic-related burnout was something people might experience where they feel \u201cincreasingly emotionally exhausted, despairing and irritable as the pandemic drags out\u201d. He compared this to what the World Health Organization has called \u201cpandemic fatigue\u201d.\u201cPandemic-related lockdowns and other restrictions disrupt our routines so that we no longer have fixed schedules or landmarks during our day \u2026 It can get to a point where every day is exactly the same. If there are no landmarks and little in the way of a fixed schedule, life becomes a blur, and people experience difficulty recalling what they did,\u201d he said.Julia Faulconbridge, the vice-chair of the division of clinical psychology at the British Psychological Society, said not everyone had the same experiences. She added that from a psychological point of view, the messaging that people had received had been hard to accept. \u201cIf you look back at early autumn things were getting worse but it was not so obvious for people. There was talk of what you would do for Christmas and vaccines coming.\u201d\u201cThen suddenly it was like all of that got swept away \u2026 suddenly the vaccine started to look more shaky as we heard about mutated strains and then, of course, we moved into this really serious crisis of health that has come since January.\u201dShe said many people would by now know someone who was ill or had died.\u201cThe whole thing becomes a lot darker in terms of what we think we are living through,\u201d she said. \u201cI would not use the term burnout but if you have pressures and stresses and difficulties going on in your life, those are almost certainly going to be exacerbated by being in lockdown.\u201cAny sort of pinch point or difficulty and stresses get exacerbated, and the longer they go on the more the pressure can build up and we are often isolated now from our normal support structures. For me, it\u2019s more than burnout, but people getting more and more trapped in difficulties \u2026 Every single person in this country is under stress to some extent or other in this pandemic.\u201cStress affects our bodies in ways that are described as burnout. That long-term stress is different from short-term and has an insidious and profound effect on how we can function. Even if we are functioning fairly well, we are not functioning as we used to.\u201d",

    "articles": "It was a sight as common as birds chirping in trees or cars idling in traffic. Nobody would do a double-take when they saw children playing with their grandparents. That was before the pandemic, when it was simply a routine image of daily life and not a potentially fatal activity.But more and more, in playgrounds across Jerusalem, a grandparent can be seen strolling along while a grandchild rushes ahead to slides and climbing frames.In this city, most older people are vaccinated against Covid-19 and are slowly emerging from nearly a year of strict isolation. While still not advised by authorities, some are cautiously returning to the thing they missed the most.\u201cThe feeling is extraordinary,\u201d said Yoel Silver, a 67-year-old lawyer, as he pushed his granddaughter on a swing. Twelve days before, Silver had received his second shot of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which initial data suggests gives a high level of resistance to the disease. For months he had mostly seen his 11 grandchildren on video calls.In a different park near the Old City of Jerusalem, another Israeli grandparent, Reuven Brauner, 70, said he and his wife had not socialised with friends but decided to visit their grandchildren after being immunised.\u201cOur understanding is that we are in a much safer position. Not 100%, but we feel sufficiently confident in the vaccine. We decided to go out and see the family,\u201d said Brauner, who wore a surgical mask over his grey beard as a precaution.His granddaughter, aged two, toddled around while her one-year-old brother lay in a pram nearby. Not being close to the younger grandchildren over the months had been especially hard, said Brauner. \u201cThey grow up so quickly at this age.\u201dIsrael is vaccinating its 9 million citizens at a higher rate than anywhere else. Close to 80% of people over 50 have received inoculations, and as of Thursday all people over 16 are eligible to receive a jab.The vaccination campaign has been the subject of intense global focus. Not only does it provide a test case for how the jabs work in the real world but it also exemplifies a highly unequal international vaccination push in which citizens of richer, more powerful nations will be first to see the benefits.While one in three Israelis has received a jab, Palestinians in the Israeli-controlled occupied territories are far behind. They are just now receiving the first batches of limited doses.Although Israel is leading the world in vaccinations, concerns remain around how much caution can be abandoned. The country is still under a lockdown, with relatively high daily infection figures.A health ministry official has advised grandparents to keep masks on and remain socially distanced from their grandchildren, warning the disease may still be transmitted by vaccinated people and keep the national infection rate high.Orli Shuruki, a 71-year-old from Jerusalem, has nine grandchildren and says she decided to get vaccinated because of them. \u201cI felt I had enough. I couldn\u2019t host my family. I could only see them through the window,\u201d she said.Her middle-aged children have also been given shots, and they decided to get together for a Saturday lunch last week for the first time in months.\u201cThe grandchildren couldn\u2019t remember when was the last time we gathered at home,\u201d she said. \u201cI think I had become depressed, and that is why I gained weight.\u201dShuruki said the family wore masks but took them off to eat, and split the tables to keep the households apart. Still, she allowed herself a brief embrace with her grandchildren.It was what the kids missed more than anything else, she said. \u201cThe hugs, only the hugs. They didn\u2019t care about what I cooked for them, only the hugs.\u201d",

    "articles": "A cheap drug normally used to treat gout has been found to have the potential to significantly reduce hospital stays among Covid-19 patients and the need for extra oxygen.The results of new research into colchicine conducted in Brazil come after an international trial published on Wednesday found that it reduced hospitalisations and deaths among Covid-19 patients by more than 20%.Colchicine, which is used to treat rheumatic diseases, was hailed by researchers as having the potential to be the first oral drug to treat Covid-19 in outpatient settings in a trial funded by the government of Quebec and philanthropists.The latest trial, funded by foundations and Brazilian authorities, suggested that the drug could lessen the body\u2019s inflammatory response and help ward off damage to the cells lining the walls of blood vessels.\u201cWhatever the mechanism of action \u2026 colchicine seems to be beneficial for the treatment of hospitalised patients with Covid-19,\u201d according to a report on the small clinical trial that appeared in the online journal RMD Open, which is published by the British Medical Journal.The researchers added that it wasn\u2019t associated with serious side-effects, such as heart or liver damage or immune system suppression, factors that have sometimes been linked to some other drugs used to treat Covid.Reductions in the need for oxygen therapy and length of hospital stay were not only good for patients but they also cut healthcare costs and the need for hospital beds, they added.However, they also expressed caution that only a small number of patients were included in the trial, and they were unable to determine if colchicine might avoid the need for intensive care or lessen the risk of death.Brazil has been hit particularly hard by the pandemic, while health workers in the country\u2019s largest state have begging for help and oxygen supplies after a sharp increase of Covid infections.While colchicine has been used to treat and prevent inflammatory conditions, a feature of some Covid infections, the researchers wanted to find out if using it could reduce the need for extra oxygen or lengthy stays in hospitals.The research was carried out between April and August last year when 75 patients admitted to hospital with moderate to severe Covid-19 were randomly assigned to receive different levels of colchicine.The results were based on 72 patients. It was found that the average length of time patients needed oxygen therapy was four days for those treated with additional colchicine, compared with 6.5 days for those who received a standard type of treatment.The average length of hospital stay was seven days for the colchicine group compared with nine for the other group.",

    "articles": "With the discovery of new coronavirus variants in parts of the UK, prompting intensive testing, we take a look at what the variants are and how concerned we should be.The terminology around viruses can be confusing, and certain terms are still debated among experts. But the general picture resembles a set of nested dolls.\u201cYou have got the coronavirus family and one strain is MERS, one strain is Sars-CoV-1, one strain is Sars-CoV-2 and another strain would be OC43 \u2013 one of the common colds,\u201d said ProfLawrence Young, virologist and professor of molecular oncology at the University of Warwick.Each strain, said Young, encompasses a number of variants. These variants differ by the set of mutations they contain \u2013 in other words the changes in their genome.Some of these mutations are \u201csilent\u201d \u2013 in other words they have no effect on the way the virus functions, but others can be important, for example changing parts of the virus that affect how easily it spreads between people. Different variants have a different collection of mutations, but they may have some changes in common with each other.While the word variant could be applied to any mutant form of the same strain, experts say the term has come to mean something different.It is a nuance that caught out Nadhim Zahawi, the UK vaccines minister, who said on Wednesday there are 4,000 variants across the world.\u201cThe vaccine minister is not referring to variants as we have come to know them, rather he is referring to individual mutations,\u201d said Prof Ravi Gupta, professor of Microbiology at the University of Cambridge.\u201cThe number of mutations has little actual relevance as many mutations emerge and disappear continuously. Scientists are using \u2018variants\u2019 to describe viruses with mutations that are transmitting in the general population \u2013 there aren\u2019t 4,000 of those.\u201dIn the UK, all eyes are on a handful of new variants of the coronavirus Sars-CoV-2, commonly known by the locations in which they were first detected. At present, key variants of concern are the South African variant (501Y.V2), the Brazilian variant (P.1) and the Kent variant (B117).These variants contain a range of mutations \u2013 some of which are worrying. Both the South African variant and the Kent variant contain a mutation called N501Y, which is believed to make the virus more contagious than older variants.The South African variant also contains mutations known as E484K and K417N, which appear to make the virus better able to evade neutralising antibodies produced by the body, suggesting current Covid vaccines will prove less effective against this variant. The Brazilian variant also contains E484K and N501Y as well as another mutation of concern called K417T.This week it was revealed that the E484K mutation has also emerged in the Kent variant \u2013 although this has only been detected in a small number of cases so far.Experts say the development is not surprising, noting that some parts of a genome are more prone to mutation, while similar mutations would be expected to crop up when the virus experiences similar evolutionary pressures.\u201cThere is selection going on for better viruses, viruses that are fitter for either transmissibility and/or immune evasion, and it is not surprising to see common changes occurring during that selection or adaptation process,\u201d said Young.Deenan Pillay, a professor of virology at University College London said the E484K mutation was a good example of this. \u201cThe fact that there is this common convergent evolution, it means that this is a common way in which the virus can escape the antibodies that are currently circulating, either from previous infection [or through vaccination],\u201d he said.Some mutations result in variants of concern \u2013 for example the higher transmissibility of the Kent variant is believed to be one factor behind the rapid uptick in infections in the UK this winter, while mutations that help a variant to evade neutralising antibodies might affect how much protection current Covid vaccines can provide.There is also a concern, said Young, that the emergence of different variants may increase the chance of someone getting Covid a second time.However, there is a flipside: known mutations make it easier to predict how a new variant might behave, while it also means vaccines can be tweaked to take into account common new mutations and boost protection against several new variants at once.And there is more. \u201cAs the virus becomes more adapted to us, and more transmissible, it might cause less disease, not more disease,\u201d said Young, adding that has been found to be the case with some other viruses.Lab tests involving the Pfizer /BioNTech and Moderna vaccines \u2013 both of which have been licensed in the UK \u2013 have suggested that jab might have a slightly lower efficacy towards the South African variant than older variants.Meanwhile, results from the Novavax Covid vaccine trials, involving two shots of the jab, found that vaccine had 95.6% efficacy against the original coronavirus, 85.6% against the Kent variant and 60% against the South Africa variant. The single-shot Janssen vaccine from Johnson &amp; Johnson also had a reduced efficacy against the South Africa variant, but still offered 57% protection against moderate to severe Covid infection 28 days after vaccination.\u201c60% is what you get with the annual flu jab,\u201d said Young, adding that is still a good level of protection. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should be panicking as much as people are at the moment about it actually.\u201dPillay added that many Covid vaccines target the spike protein, which sits on the surface of the coronavirus. Crucially, he said, the antibodies generated in response to the vaccine target many different parts of this protein, meaning a change in one region as a result of a mutation would be unlikely to mean the variant can evade all the different antibodies.But as more mutations accumulate, it is possible vaccine efficacy could fall further. Scientists are working towards developing new versions of Covid vaccines tweaked towards new variants, with one possibility that vaccines could be targeted at more than one type of the spike protein.Young said another approach would be to create vaccines that target several different parts of the virus \u2013 not just the spike protein on its surface.Pillay said while variants are often linked to particular locations, that did not mean that is where they arose. \u201cWherever there are a large number of infections and you are sequencing them, you are going to find [these new variants],\u201d he said.Stopping the emergence of new variants is no mean feat. \u201cThe only way you can stop new variants is by stamping out the virus because the more the virus is allowed to spread \u2026 the more chances it has to evolve and form new variants,\u201d said Young.That, he said, means getting vaccines into arms, while also sticking to other measures to prevent spread, including social distancing.Pillay added that a well functioning test, trace, isolate and support system was also crucial, as were measures at the borders. \u201cYou need to close the borders, absolutely, to stop these [variants] spreading across borders,\u201d he said.",

    "articles": "The Covid vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca is nearly as effective against the Kent variant as it is against older forms of the virus, according to preliminary research results.Researchers analysed swabs from trial volunteers who developed asymptomatic or symptomatic infections to determine which variant of the virus they had caught after receiving the vaccine or a control jab.In a preprint under review at the Lancet, the scientists reported that levels of neutralising antibodies \u2013 those that wipe out the virus \u2013 were nine times lower in vaccinated people who caught the Kent variant, named B117, compared with those who contracted older variants.But the reduced antibody response was associated with only slightly lower protection against symptomatic infections with the Kent variant, the scientists said. Among the small number of people included in the study, vaccine efficacy fell from an average of 84% against older variants to 75% against the Kent variant.Despite the fall, the protection against what is now the dominant variant in the UK remains substantially above the 50% threshold the World Health Organization set as the pandemic took hold.The latest results are drawn from swabs taken between 1 October 2020, about two weeks after the first known case of B117 infection was detected in Kent, and 14 January. By that time the more transmissible variant had spread rapidly from Kent, London and the east across the rest of the country.The findings are the first to examine how well the Oxford vaccine, known as ChAdOx1, protects against the variant, which is one of a number of mutated forms of the virus causing concern around the world. B117 is about 50% more transmissible and perhaps 30% more deadly than older variants, though work is ongoing to confirm its lethality.Of more concern are new variants first discovered in South Africa and Brazil, which both bear a mutation called E484K. Early studies suggest the mutation may help the virus to evade immunity induced by vaccines and past Covid infection. The E484K mutation recently appeared among B117 variants, prompting fears the virus could become harder to control.Andrew Pollard, a professor of paediatric infection and immunity, and chief investigator on the Oxford vaccine trial, said: \u201cOver the last couple of months we\u2019ve seen very similar efficacy of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine against the B117, UK, or Kent variant, very similar to the original virus that was circulating last year.\u201dCountry\u00a0US/GermanyEfficacy 95% a week after the second shot. Pfizer says it is only 52% after the first dose but the UK\u2019s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) says this may rise to 90% after 21 days.The UK has ordered 40m doses and is rolling them out nowDoses Clinical trials involved two doses 21 days apart. The UK is stretching this to 12 weeks.Country\u00a0UKEfficacy 70.4% 14 days after receiving the second dose. May have up to 90% efficacy when given as a half dose followed by a full dose. No severe disease or hospitalisations in anyone who received the vaccine.\u00a0The UK has ordered 100m doses and has begun distributionDoses\u00a0Two, four to 12 weeks apartCountry\u00a0USEfficacy Phase 3 trial results suggest an rating of 94.1%.The UK has ordered 17m doses, to be delivered in March or AprilDoses\u00a0Two, 28 days apartCountry\u00a0USEfficacy\u00a0Phase 3 trials suggest 89.3%.60m doses ordered by the UK, with distribution expected principally in the second half of the yearDoses\u00a0TwoCountry\u00a0USEfficacy 72% in preventing mild to moderate cases in US trials but 66% efficacy observed in international trials. 85% efficacy against severe illness, and 100% protection against hospitalisation and death.30m doses ordered by the UKDoses: One, making it unique among Covid vaccines with phase 3 results so farThe data is preliminary and involves swabs from only 499 trial volunteers. Of 1,524 positive nose and throat swabs collected from the participants, 323 swabs from 256 people yielded virus that was identified by genetic sequencing.Further analysis revealed that those who received the Oxford jab but still became infected shed the virus for a shorter time and had lower viral loads than those in the control group. The findings may help to explain why the vaccine appears to reduce transmission by as much as two-thirds after the first shot.Danny Altmann, a professor of immunology at Imperial College London, said the findings were positive. \u201cBy any standards this is very good news as the B117 variant with its increased transmission had the potential to derail our planned timeline for recovery.\u201cThis variant has been thought of as mainly facilitating transmission rather than evasion of immunity \u2013 the prediction from antibody neutralisation tests in the lab had been that the vaccine would still be protective. However, there\u2019s a big gap between showing this in the lab and showing actual protection in the population. We still need to worry about the other variants with the E484K mutation, as in the South Africa variant and the new mutation in the UK. That\u2019s the one where we really need a keen eye on how well the vaccines work,\u201d he said.Sarah Gilbert, a professor of vaccinology and chief investigator on the Oxford vaccine trial, said the team\u2019s platform technology allowed them to quickly update the vaccine to target new variants should that become necessary. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect to go through the full process of clinical trials again,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will be talking to regulators about the exact procedure that we\u2019re going to be going through for using these updated vaccines, but there\u2019s precedent from flu vaccines. This is done every year for flu vaccines.\u201dThe results came as the UK government announced a partnership with the vaccine manufacturer CureVac to rapidly develop vaccines against new variants. The government has placed an initial order for 50m mRNA vaccines from CureVac to be delivered later this year if needed. Almost all of the vaccines developed by the partnership will be versions of an existing jab CureVac has in phase 3 clinical trials.",

    "articles": "A more contagious variant of the coronavirus first detected in Britain now accounts for almost 6% of all cases in Germany, officials said Friday.The head of Germany\u2019s disease control agency said labs examined the genome of the virus in more than 30,000 positive samples last week to assess the spread of the variant, known to scientists as B.1.1.7., and two others that were first found in South Africa and Brazil.\u201cThe three variants, particularly B.1.1.7., have arrived in Germany,\u201d Lothar Wieler, president of the Robert Koch Institute, told reporters in Berlin.\u201cThey\u2019re not dominant yet, but we have to reckon that their share will continue to rise, just as it has been reported from other European countries in recent weeks.\u201dGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said Thursday that the prevalence of new variants of the virus will play a role in discussions between the federal and state governments next week about whether to extend existing lockdown restrictions beyond mid-February.Wieler said the variant first observed in Britain and now detected in 13 of Germany\u2019s 16 states \u201cis more contagious than the existing one, and there are first indications that it can also lead to more serious illnesses.\u201dThe US House of Representatives was expected to approve a budget measure on Friday that would enable Democrats to push President Joe Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package through Congress without Republican support in a process that will likely take weeks. The senate narrowly approved a version of the budget plan at the end of a marathon debate that went into Friday morning. House leaders said lawmakers will begin a procedural vote around midday, and if that succeeds, the budget will be deemed adopted. Democrats and the Biden administration have said they want comprehensive legislation to move quickly to address a pandemic that has killed more than 450,000 Americans and left millions jobless. Italy reported 377 coronavirus-related deaths on Friday against 421 the day before, the health ministry said, while the daily tally of new infections rose to 14,218 from 13,659 the day before. Some 270,507 tests for Covid-19 were carried out in the past day, virtually stable compared with a previous 270,142, the health ministry said. Italy has registered 90,618 deaths linked to COVID-19 since its outbreak emerged last February, the second-highest toll in Europe after Britain and the sixth-highest in the world. The country has reported 2.61 million cases to date. Patients in the hospital with Covid-19 - not including those in intensive care - stood at 19,575 on Friday, down from 19,743 a day earlier.Britain\u2019s Oxford University said on Friday its researchers behind the joint AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine had found it to be effective against the UK virus variant now dominant across the country.The university, which developed the jab with the British-Swedish pharmaceutical firm, said an ongoing assessment of its effectiveness showed that it has \u201csimilar efficacy\u201d to other coronavirus strains. \u201cData from our trials... in the United Kingdom indicate that the vaccine not only protects against the original pandemic virus but also protects against the novel variant,\u201d said Andrew Pollard, a co-chief investigator on the Oxford vaccine trial.The analysis, which relied on samples taken between October and mid-January, also indicated the jab reduces \u201cduration of shedding and viral load\u201d, which may translate into reduced virus transmission, the university said.President Joe Biden said on Friday that fresh data on the health of the US jobs market shows the need for aggressive action by Congress on a coronavirus relief bill. Meeting with top Democrats from the US House of Representatives at the White House, Biden said the US would not return to full employment at the current jobs-creation pace for 10 years, underscoring the need for lawmakers to act.European nations need to work more closely with drug firms to increase the pace of coronavirus inoculations, the World Health Organization said, as Johnson &amp; Johnson pushed for its jab to become the third approved for use in the US.EU chiefs have engaged in bitter public rows with firms over supply shortages and legal obligations, as a slow vaccine rollout has sparked public anger and plunged the bloc\u2019s leadership into crisis.\u201cWe need to join up to speed up vaccinations,\u201d the World Health Organization\u2019s Europe director, Hans Kluge, told AFP in an interview.\u201cOtherwise, competing pharmaceutical companies (must) join efforts to drastically increase production capacity \u2026 that\u2019s what we need,\u201d he added.In a sign of Europe\u2019s increasing urgency, top EU diplomat Josep Borrell said he hoped Russia\u2019s Sputnik V jab would be approved for use in Europe soon.\u201cIt\u2019s good news for the whole of mankind because it means we will have more tools to fight the pandemic,\u201d he said during a visit to Moscow.Experts have warned that vaccines will only control the contagion \u2013 which has killed more than 2 million people since emerging in late 2019 \u2013 if the whole world is covered.Although more than 115m shots have so far been administered, most have been in high-income countries.Kluge reiterated the WHO\u2019s call for rich countries to help poorer parts of the world, urging them to donate spare doses after inoculating the most vulnerable parts of their populations.Hello, I am taking over the blog while my colleague takes a break. Please get in touch if you want to share comments and news tips.Twitter: @sloumarshInstagram: sarah_marsh_journalistEmail: sarah.marsh@theguardian.comAstraZeneca expects results from the US clinical trial of its Covid-19 vaccine in the next four to six weeks, the firm\u2019s research chief Mene Pangalos has said.Reuters reports that asked about when the trial results would be ready, given high transmission rates during the trial, Pangalos said that they had been high during \u201cthe latter period of the trial\u201d.I think we\u2019re getting very close to getting data. I would say in the next four to six weeks we should have the results for that study reading out.Some experts had expected the data sooner than that, given the high infection rates in the US during the period of testing.The US recorded more than 5,000 Covid-19 deaths today. The surge, the highest number to date, seems to be largely due to a backlog of data that was just released from Indiana, adding 1,500 deaths to the countrywide number, according to the Wall Street Journal. Though cases have otherwise been slowing down, the death toll is often a reflection of what happened in the weeks prior, since it\u2019s usually a lagging indicator of the virus spread. Yesterday, there were 5,077 US deaths in total, according to John Hopkins University data, and 122,473 new cases.South Africa, hardest hit by Covid across Africa, has secured enough Covid vaccines for at least 26 million people and knows where it will source the other doses it needs, the health minister has said, Reuters reports.Africa\u2019s most industrialised economy has recorded the most COVID-19 infections and deaths on the continent, at more than 1.4 million cases and more than 45,000 deaths to date.It plans to start inoculations soon, after receiving its first million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine from the Serum Institute of India (SII) this week. It aims to vaccinate 40 million people, or two-thirds of its population, to reach herd immunity.Health minister Zweli Mkhize told a parliamentary committee it would take roughly three months to complete the first phase of the vaccination plan focused on healthcare workers. The next phase, which includes those aged over 60, those deemed essential workers and those with co-morbidities, could take six months.\u201cWe don\u2019t expect this plan to be smooth in its implementation,\u201d Mkhize said, after some scientists and opposition politicians criticised the government for not procuring vaccines more swiftly. \u201cIt\u2019s a new programme, it\u2019s a huge programme, to think that everything is going to be smooth according to the letter of the plan I think we would be misleading you.\u201dSouth Africa expects to get another 500,000 doses from SII in the coming weeks, as well as 12 million from the Covax facility co-led by the World Health Organization, 20 million from Pfizer and 9 million from Johnson &amp; Johnson.A Florida, US, police officer has been fired following a coworker\u2019s complaint that he mocked her concerns about the coronavirus, hugged her against her wishes and misled investigators who probed the allegations against him, according to records reported by AP.An internal investigation by the Longwood police department found Cpl. David Hernandez was \u201cnot fully forthcoming and not truthful\u201d when questioned about the interaction in July with the woman, the Orlando Sentinel reported.The co-worker \u201ctold you not to touch her and physically backed away from you and crossed her arms,\u201d police chief David Dowda wrote in his review of the case, which the newspaper obtained through a public records request.\u201cThis was more than sufficient indication for you to know to stop trying to embrace her; however you ignored her comments and moments later embraced her,\u201d the chief wrote.The woman said she made it clear that she feared contracting COVID-19. Hernandez ignored her and followed her into her work space, the report said. There he kept \u201ctaunting her with comments about her being afraid of contracting Covid-19,\u201d while sitting at her desk and \u201ctouching items on her desk,\u201d the report said.Hernandez, an officer with the department since 2005, only left when the woman went to a supervisor, the report said. The woman said she cut her finger and hurt her back while pushing Hernandez away, the report said.Seven million Italians could be fully vaccinated against Covid by the end of March, if vaccine supplies are confirmed, the government\u2019s special commissioner Domenico Arcuri has said.Arcuri said the first 249,600 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine would arrive in Italy tomorrow and would be administered from next week, to people up to the age of 55, Reuters reports. Pfizer and Moderna doses will be administered in parallel, to those over 80 and most exposed to risks, such as health workers.Meanwhile, the number of Italians that are fully vaccinated will top 1 million today ... We have about one million people who have received both the first and second dose, ahead of Germany with 756,000.Asked about recent production disruptions and supply cuts, the commissioner said he was waiting for the EU and the vaccine manufacturers to agree over the proposal to transfer part of their production to local sites to increase capacity.\u201cWe believe Italy has the facilities and the characteristics to contribute to an increase in production,\u201d he added.Arcuri added that the average daily number of doses administered had returned to 83,000 per day after falling by more than half in the last two weeks of January.On the AstraZeneca vaccine, which is recommended for use in people up to 55 years old, he said he was confident that \u201cfurther trials may allow it to be used within a wider share of the population.\u201d Ghanaian MPs who had contracted Covid continued to attend parliament, according to the speaker, Alban Bagbin.Bagbin threatened to expose MPs that continued to attend while announcing that parliament would reduce sittings to just twice just a week. According to local reports, parliamentary leaders are likely to bar MPs from attending.An outbreak of coronavirus in Ghana\u2019s parliament has seen 15 MPs and over 50 legislative test positive, as cases rise sharply across the country. Many in Ghana are angry at the lax attitude to covid among some of the country\u2019s legislators while stricter measures affecting ordinary citizens have been adopted to curb a second wave of infections, now seen in many West African countries.The country is seeing about 700 infections a day, with 7,000 active cases, more than tripling over the last fortnight. There has been an estimated total of 440 deaths.On Sunday, president Nana Akufo-Addo placed an indefinite ban on weddings, parties and limited private funerals to 25 people. He also added beaches, nightclubs, cinemas and pubs will continue to be shut whiles the country\u2019s domestic land and sea borders remain closed.Like many countries in the region struggling to procure vaccines amid global competition, prospects are slowly rising but remain a challenge. Ghana plans to procure 17 million doses by the end of June for its population of 30 million people. The first batches would arrive in March, Akufo-Addo said, without specifying which vaccines they would be. The leaders of Denmark, Austria, the Czech Republic and Greece have urged the European Commission to act quickly to secure supplies of the Covid-19 vaccine developed by US drugmaker Johnson &amp; Johnson, Reuters reports.In the letter, addressed to commission President Ursula von der Leyen, they said they had been informed that the new vaccine needed to be shipped to the United States for filling and finishing.If this could risk EU access to the vaccines, we should consider addressing the issue already now with a view to finding solutions with the company in order to safeguard European supply.It was signed by Austrian chancellor Sebastian Kurz, Czech prime minister Andrej Babis, Danish prime minister Mette Frederiksen and Greek prime minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis. A member of the World Health Organization-led team visiting the central Chinese city of Wuhan said he has been surprised by the complexity of getting to the origins of the pandemic and that years of research lay ahead, Reuters reports.Dominic Dwyer, a microbiologist and infectious diseases expert, said:Everybody knows how it really exploded out of Huanan market in Wuhan, but the key is what was happening around that time and before. Dwyer, an Australian specialist in HIV/AIDS who previously worked with the WHO during the SARS and avian flu outbreaks, said the \u201cconundrum\u201d of Covid-19 was that early asymptomatic carriers may not have known they had it.\u201cIt would be naive to think that we\u2019re going to get virus zero,\u201d Dwyer said. The early cases were identified in November, \u201cbut it\u2019s just the bit beforehand that\u2019s the very interesting part and the tricky part and the difficult part\u201d.Dwyer echoed his teammate Peter Daszak, a zoologist and animal disease expert, in his emphasis on the difficulty of understanding the disease. \u201cEven SARS, even Ebola, we have some good ideas, but no one knows,\u201d Daszak said yesterday. \u201cHIV: we don\u2019t know the exact circumstances.\u201dSerbia will invest as much as necessary to start domestic production of Russia\u2019s Sputnik V by the end of the year, president Aleksandar Vucic has said.A group of Russian experts is expected to visit Serbia next week for talks about local production of the Sputnik V vaccine by the end of the year, Reuters reports. Vucic said he and Russian president Vladimir Putin made an initial agreement about the launch of the production procedure which he described as \u201ccomplicated and difficult.\u201dWith over 530,000 people, or around 7.5% of its population, inoculated against Covid-19, Serbia globally holds the fourth highest vaccination rate per 100 people, behind Israel, Britain and the US.",

    "articles": "The US Senate has passed a budget resolution that allows for the passage of Joe Biden\u2019s $1.9tn (\u00a31.4tn) Covid-19 relief package in the coming weeks without Republican support.The vice-president, Kamala Harris, broke a 50/50 tie by casting a vote in favour of the Democratic measure, which sends it to the House of Representatives for final approval. It marked the first time Harris, in her role as president of the Senate, cast a tie-breaking vote after being sworn in as the first female vice-president on 20 January.The House passed its own budget measure on Wednesday. Congress can now work to write a bill that can be passed by a simple majority in both houses, which are controlled by Democrats. Mid-March has been suggested as a likely date by which the measure could be passed, a point at which enhanced unemployment benefits will expire if Congress does not act.The vote came at 5.30am on Friday at the end of a marathon Senate debate session, known among senators as a \u201cvote-a-rama\u201d, a procedure whereby they can theoretically offer unlimited amendments. Biden is scheduled to meet with Democratic House leaders and committee chairs early on Friday morning to discuss the Covid economic stimulus, and is expected to make public remarks on the progress at an 11.45am EST (1645 GMT) briefing.There was dissent from Republicans in the Senate overnight, particularly over plans for a $15 federal minimum wage. Iowa\u2019s Republican senator, Joni Ernst, raised an amendment to \u201cprohibit the increase of the federal minimum wage during a global pandemic\u201d, which was carried by a voice vote.The Vermont senator Bernie Sanders said he still intended to support bringing the measure through: \u201cWe need to end the crisis of starvation wages in Iowa and around the United States.\u201dHe outlined plans to get a wage increase, phased in over five years, included in a budget reconciliation bill. The federal minimum wage is currently $7.25 an hour, and has not been raised since 2009.In a tweet after the vote, Sanders said: \u201cToday, with the passage of this budget resolution to provide relief to our working families, we have the opportunity not only to address the pandemic and the economic collapse \u2013 we have the opportunity to give hope to the American people and restore faith in our government.\u201dDuring the debate Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell said \u201cThis is not the time for trillions more dollars to make perpetual lockdowns and economic decline a little more palatable. Notwithstanding the actual needs, notwithstanding all the talk about bipartisan unity, Democrats in Congress are plowing ahead. They\u2019re using this phony budget to set the table to ram through their $1.9 trillion rough draft.\u201dThe $1.9 trillion relief package proposed would be used to speed Covid-19 vaccines throughout the nation. Other funds would extend special unemployment benefits that will expire at the end of March and make direct payments to people to help them pay bills and stimulate the economy. Democrats also want to send money to state and local governments dealing with the worst health crisis in decades.",

    "articles": "When the request went out for a \u201cbespectacled guinea pig\u201d to test if anti-fog treatments actually work when you wear a face mask, I was desperate.As someone with such a strong genetic predisposition for eyesight issues that I practically came out of the womb wearing glasses, lens fogging has long been a frustration. Even when I\u2019m not wearing a mask, my glasses will fog up after something as innocent as a run for the bus.Now that mask use is the norm, glasses fogging has become an unavoidable part of daily life. And it\u2019s absolutely maddening.As a journalist, the rising fog has become particularly stressful at press conferences.Having repeatedly asked New South Wales premier Gladys Berejiklian what she believed the benefits were of holding off making masks mandatory in late December, I was cursing myself in the coming days when, after she urged everyone to wear one as a precaution, I found myself unable to see her standing two metres in front of me.Recently, I\u2019ve resorted to wearing a face shield on late-night trips to the supermarket, mocked by friends who\u2019ve caught me in the act. I thought there had to be a better way.It turns out, there is.I was able to pick up a pack of Clearwipe Antifog Lens Cleaners from Chemist Warehouse for $4.49, and they\u2019re widely available elsewhere too. The box contains 20 single-use microfibre wipes \u2013 in little sachets, similar to hand cleaners from fast-food restaurants.These also clean your lenses, and unlike the spray and gel, are only designed for eyeglasses.These wipes are easy to apply and the glasses dry quickly, but while they made my lenses look nice and clear, as you\u2019d expect from a cleaning product, the anti-fog results were underwhelming.To test if these wipes work, I wore a disposable mask, with the wire bent snugly around my nose and the loops inverted around my ears (a tip I\u2019d heard reduces fogging).My glasses fogged after taking a few average breaths and speaking some random words to mimic conversation.The verdict: There was slightly less fog compared with untreated glasses, but not enough to stop me being driven insane after 30 seconds.Dr Film\u2019s Premium Anti-Fog Spray ($29.95) applies just how you\u2019d imagine a spray would. After coating both the front and back of each lens to give it the best chance at success, I let the liquid dry without rinsing, as per the instructions.Once it dries, there is a very fine but noticeable film over the lenses, which makes the glasses slightly translucent \u2013 the sort of state that would ordinarily prompt you to clean them.Using a different pair of glasses, but the same disposable mask \u2013 with nose wire and inverted ear straps \u2013 I took some test breaths and spoke.My glasses still fogged up, but it wasn\u2019t as intense as with bare lenses. While the fogging seemed limited to the edges of the lens frames, it was still very noticeable.The verdict: This spray is also designed to be used on sports goggles and snorkelling masks. So it\u2019s possible that while it can deal with the heat and associated steam that come off eyeballs, it can\u2019t cope with hot breath.Pro Gear\u2019s Anti-Fog Cleaning Gel ($19.95) is fiddly. It comes in a tiny (5g) tube, which needs to be unscrewed \u2013 no easy task. From there you need to cut the tip of the tube\u2019s spout with scissors.Using a third pair of glasses, I applied a very small dot, about the size of a sesame seed, on to both the front and back of each lens, and rubbed it in with the cloth provided until the lenses were dry.I put the glasses on and wore the same test mask as previously.I took a deep breath in, and exhaled. No fog. I then exclaimed \u201cWow, no fog!\u201d \u2013 an utterance which produced no fog.I then tried with a reusable face mask (mine was from Uniqlo) which I\u2019d bought months ago, and wore once before realising it didn\u2019t have a nose-fitting wire and fogged my glasses. Even with this mask, I was able to breath and talk without fogging my glasses at all.I brought the glasses to my mouth and hushed heavily on them \u2013 in the way you do before wiping them generally. No fog.So excited by the clear lenses in front of me, I ran to turn on my kettle and stuck my face directly over the rising steam.No fog. However doing this seemed to push the limits of the gel\u2019s technology, as a slight water residue formed along parts of the lenses. This didn\u2019t fog up the lenses, but it made my glasses a tad blurry until the water dried about 30 seconds later.The verdict: It\u2019s hard to believe I went months before trying this gel, and given it\u2019s cheaper than the somewhat less effective spray, I\u2019ll be recommending it to every four-eyes I see in the street.",

    "articles": "It\u2019s easier to relate to your boss when they\u2019re being nuzzled by their dog. There\u2019s something humanising about the appearance of pets during work video calls \u2013 and it can bring teams closer together in spite of the physical distance.\u201cNearly all of us have been in virtual meetings where kids or pets have popped up ... You connect more with the people behind the corporate roles when you know a bit more about their home life and families,\u201d says Katharine King, global research director at GVC Group, the gaming business.With the pandemic expected to continue well into next year, it\u2019s understandable for remote-work fatigue to set in. But focusing on the many upsides of working from home can help. The time and money saved by avoiding long commutes, and not having to maintain an expensive work wardrobe immediately come to mind.Other upsides stem from operational changes. Making time for a quick \u201cmini-meeting\u201d every morning to check in and chat has boosted morale for many scattered across the country. \u201cUnexpectedly it\u2019s brought our team closer,\u201d says Jill Kidson, head of consumer marketing at the children\u2019s publisher Walker Books.Using technology to chat throughout the day also has its benefits. First thing every morning, Katie Jansons, part of the IT operations team for the AA, opens her online chat and keeps it running all day so her team, which includes five people in Bangalore, can chime in whenever they need to share something. \u201cAll the niceties are now virtual. Maybe [this shift] has humanised us because we\u2019ve all needed that extra personal connection.\u201dOne unexpected benefit of remote work was having the time to really get to know a new starter on her team. \u201cIf we were in the office, I\u2019d be in meetings, but [at home] having video calls and constant conversations with them has been more rewarding.\u201dA Friday wrap-up call brings each week to a close for Jansons\u2019s eight-strong team \u2013 with the help of a music playlist. \u201cWe refer to it as #deskdisco,\u201d she says. In early summer, all the UK-based IT service portfolio managers shared a virtual cream tea, eaten at individual addresses across the country, in a bid to have a team experience after other planned awaydays had been cancelled.Then there are the bigger operational upsides. For some this simply means more people turning up for meetings, as dialling in from home affords fewer excuses not to show your face. When Deborah Mack, the new interim director of the Smithsonian National Museum of African Art, held her first meeting, it had to be via a video call. She had 100% attendance, a first for an all-staff meeting.For some firms, the pivot to remote work has proved the ideal opportunity to reboot how they run their businesses, including transforming their digital operations. This may mean adopting new digital processes and initiatives or even switching digital workflow platforms entirely.The AA is a client of ServiceNow, a leader in digital workflow solutions. As the AA\u2019s continuous improvement and tooling solutions manager, Jansons manages the IT service management solution for all IT interactions. Everyone who works for the AA, from frontline patrols to contact centre staff, has instant access to the AA\u2019s IT support department if they need technical assistance.During the pandemic, the need to keep things running despite staff being geographically distanced prompted the AA to roll out chatbot virtual agents, powered by ServiceNow. \u201cIndividual home broadband speed suddenly became part of our infrastructure in a way we hadn\u2019t envisioned before,\u201d says Jansons. \u201cIt became a high priority. We configured our virtual agent to be able to talk users through how to check home broadband, ensure it was plugged in correctly etc, and to [send] that information in a ticket to our IT support team.\u201dAnother big benefit came from rolling out ServiceNow\u2019s Agent Workspace for the AA\u2019s service desk, which reduced the amount of time it took to log details of an IT incident. \u201cA new dynamic user interface sped up our ticket handling, reducing the time it takes to raise an average [IT issue] by a minute. We saved the equivalent of approximately eight hours a week for the service desk team, which is about one working day,\u201d says Jansons. Her team has also launched the ServiceNow mobile app, which she says is like a virtual version of the AA\u2019s office-based tech hub, where staff could previously get IT assistance.At GVC Group, King has found that getting more out of technology has been a big unexpected benefit. \u201cNow everyone is comfortable doing things virtually, we can mix teams up and do activities like training and development or business updates with people who we don\u2019t usually work with in different offices or countries.\u201d Zero travel time means she can join in meetings with colleagues in other time zones, and persuade those geographically distant to adapt their working day. \u201c[Colleagues in the US] don\u2019t mind rolling out of bed and straight into meetings and then taking back the time at the other end of their day,\u201d she adds.Annie Auerbach, who wrote a book about the benefits of a more flexible approach to working life \u2013 Flex: Reinventing Work for a Smarter, Happier Life \u2013 agrees. \u201cWe are gaining freedom to listen to our circadian rhythms and mould our days accordingly. If you are a night owl, embrace the evenings and let the morning be slow. If you are a lark \u2013 and are waking even earlier with angst \u2013 work while the kids sleep.\u201dAuerbach adds that the benefits work both ways. \u201cThere are significant benefits to business, including accessing the best talent, who might have been excluded from macho working cultures of long hours and presenteeism.\u201dOther intangible upsides include the new kind of creativity that can be fostered by working from home \u2013 thanks, for instance, to the ability to think more obliquely while going for a stroll, or finding inspiration while just flicking through a magazine.ServiceNow gives you the power to make work, work better \u2013 no matter the circumstances.

    "articles": "Dr Rochelle Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the agency will be releasing guidance on safely reopening schools \u201cin the week ahead\u201d. Earlier this week, Walensky said schools could safely reopen before all teachers received coronavirus vaccines. But the White House later walked that back, saying Walensky\u2019s comments should be not treated as the official guidance of the CDC.The conversation about vaccinating teachers comes as some teachers\u2019 unions have threatened to strike if their members are asked to return to schools before being vaccinated.The White House coronavirus response team\u2019s briefing has now concluded.A reporter asked whether the White House coronavirus response team has already seen any benefit from Joe Biden\u2019s order asking Americans to wear masks for the first 100 days of his presidency.Dr Rochelle Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said it was still too early to draw any conclusions about the impact of the order.But Walensky added that initial studies in 10 states indicated that coronavirus hospitalization rates went down after three weeks of the mask order.The Defense Production Act will be invoked to help Pfizer obtain equipment to meet its vaccine production targets, the White House pandemic response team announced.The DPA is a law allowing the president to compel companies to manufacture certain products to address urgent national needs.Tim Manning, the pandemic response team supply coordinator, also said that 61 million at-home coronavirus tests will be available to Americans by the end of summer. The White House coronavirus response team is now holding a briefing to provide an update on vaccine distribution.Andy Slavitt, a senior White House adviser on the pandemic response, announced that the defense department has approved sending more than 1,000 active-duty personnel to support vaccine distribution. The troops\u2019 efforts will start in California, where two mass vaccination sites are now opening in Los Angeles and Oakland.Slavitt also announced that six companies will help expand production of at-home coronavirus tests, with the goal of having \u201cmillions\u201d of tests available by the summer.Earlier this week, the pandemic response team announced a partnership with the healthcare company Ellume, which has produced the first at-home, over-the counter coronavirus test.Democrats are pointing to this morning\u2019s grim jobs report to make the case for Joe Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package.\u201cThe latest jobs report is another confirmation that Americans need relief now\u2014and that\u2019s why Senate Democrats took a big first step toward passing a historic COVID relief package early this morning, with Vice President Kamala Harris casting the deciding vote,\u201d Jaime Harrison, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said in a statement.\u201cDemocrats are delivering on our promises: relief checks that will put more money directly in Americans\u2019 pockets, help for small businesses and individuals who have lost their jobs or gotten sick during this pandemic, funding for local governments to speed up vaccinations and increase testing, and so much more,\u201d Harrison added. \u201cThis is leadership. This is what Americans voted for in November.\u201dThe Senate approved the Democratic budget resolution early this morning, paving the way to pass Biden\u2019s relief package without Republican support.Joe Biden is holding a meeting with House Democratic leaders and committee chairs in the Oval Office.Speaking to reporters at the start of the meeting, the president emphasized the need to pass another massive coronavirus relief package. Biden said the governmental response to the financial crisis had taught him the negative impact of going too small with relief proposals.\u201cWe got a chance to do something big here.\u201dBiden and Harris met with House Democratic leaders and committee leaders who are helping to put together the stimulus legislation pic.twitter.com/eV2zANuP90\u201cThe one thing we learned is we can\u2019t do too much here. We can do too little. We can do too little and sputter,\u201d Biden said.\u201cIt\u2019s not just the macroeconomic impact on the economy and our ability to compete internationally,\u201d the president added. \u201cIt\u2019s people\u2019s lives. Real live people are hurting and we can fix it. We can fix it and the irony and all ironies is: if we help them, we are also helping our competitive capacity through the remainder of this decade.\u201dThe Senate approved the Democratic budget resolution early this morning, paving the way to pass Biden\u2019s relief package without any Republican support.House speaker Nancy Pelosi said she wanted the chamber to pass Joe Biden\u2019s coronavirus relief package by the end of the month.In a new \u201cDear colleague\u201d letter to her fellow Democratic caucus members, Pelosi celebrated the Senate\u2019s passage of the budget resolution early this morning, which paved the way to pass coronavirus relief without Republican support.\u201cAs we all know, a budget is a statement of our values. Our work to crush the coronavirus and deliver relief to the American people is urgent and of the highest priority. With this budget resolution, we have taken a giant step to save lives and livelihoods,\u201d Pelosi said in the letter.The House speaker and the Democratic chairs of key House committees are now meeting with Biden at the White House to discuss the relief package.\u201cNext week, we will be writing the legislation to create a path to final passage for the Biden American Rescue Plan, so that we can finish our work before the end of February,\u201d Pelosi said in her letter.The Senate is working on a different timetable for passing coronavirus relief because the chamber must conduct Donald Trump\u2019s second impeachment trial next week, delaying next steps on the relief package until after a verdict has been reached.Financial experts are noting that this morning\u2019s jobs report showed the US labor force participation rate dropped slightly to 61.4%.Labor Force Participation Rate ticked down to 61.4% pic.twitter.com/DQ8bt8G60uThat means that about 400,000 Americans left the job market last month because they hadn\u2019t found work and decided to stop looking.In comparison, the US economy added just 49,000 jobs last month, according to the jobs report.Those figures help to explain why the US unemployment rate ticked down last month, but the number is clearly decreasing for the wrong reasons. The Washington Post has published an op-ed from Larry Summers, the former director of the national economic council under Barack Obama, that is causing some trouble for Democrats this morning.In the op-ed, Summers argues that Joe Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief proposal is too large. He writes: I agree with the general consensus of progressive economists that it would have been much better if the Obama administration had been able to legislate a much larger fiscal stimulus in early 2009, in response to the Great Recession. Yet a comparison of the 2009 stimulus and what is now being proposed is instructive. In 2009, the gap between actual and estimated potential output was about $80 billion a month and increasing. The 2009 stimulus measures provided an incremental $30 billion to $40 billion a month during 2009 \u2014 an amount equal to about half the output shortfall.In contrast, recent Congressional Budget Office estimates suggest that with the already enacted $900 billion package \u2014 but without any new stimulus \u2014 the gap between actual and potential output will decline from about $50 billion a month at the beginning of the year to $20 billion a month at its end. The proposed stimulus will total in the neighborhood of $150 billion a month, even before consideration of any follow-on measures. That is at least three times the size of the output shortfall.In other words, whereas the Obama stimulus was about half as large as the output shortfall, the proposed Biden stimulus is three times as large as the projected shortfall. Relative to the size of the gap being addressed, it is six times as large.Some Democratic lawmakers, such as Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii, were quick to dismiss the op-ed, saying Summers did not have credibility on the matter given his response to the financial crisis.Why would we listen to the economist who admits he went too small last time if he\u2019s warning us to go small again? I swear this town is nuts. It\u2019s like people can only remember thirty names and so they just keep going back to the same people.This is Joan Greve in Washington, taking over for Martin Belam.Joe Biden will soon meet with House Democratic leaders and committee chairs to discuss his proposed coronavirus relief package. After the meeting, Biden will deliver a speech on the new jobs report and the need to deliver more coronavirus relief as many families continue to struggle financially because of the pandemic. That\u2019s all coming up soon, so stay tuned. Robinhood, the financial trading platform that is credited with both enabling, and then inhibiting, the unprecedented rise of Gamestop stocks, lifted all trading restrictions this morning, allowing users to buy shares in Reddit-promoted companies after a week of financial tumult.The company has been criticized by users after it limited the amount of Gamestop and AMC shares individuals could purchase following a Reddit-led spike in certain companies\u2019 share prices. \u201cThere are currently no temporary limits to increasing your positions,\u201d Robinhood said in a statement on its website.Robinhood had only allowed users to trade 500 shares in GameStop, a video game store chain, and 5,500 AMC shares, according to Reuters, after an initial surge in mid-January. The lifting of restrictions came as the US treasury department reportedly began to explore preventing a similar set of events from happening again.Robinhood had been accused of protecting hedge funds, some of whom pay the company to execute its users\u2019 trades, when it introduced restrictions on purchases.Thousands of small traders had used Robinhood \u2013 which positioned itself as a user-friendly platform for inexperienced investors \u2013 to purchase Gamestop, AMC, Blackberry and other companies after the WallStreetBets sub-Reddit inspired a mass trading event.Politicians as ideologically diverse as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Ted Cruz have criticized Robinhood, with Ocasio-Cortez suggesting a congressional hearing into the company. But Robinhood said the restrictions were necessary for it to cover potential losses.Read more here: Robinhood lifts all trading restrictions including Gamestop and AMC sharesCBS News report this morning that the Pennsylvania home of Capitol riot suspect Rachell Powell has been raided by the FBI. She has become known as the \u201cbullhorn lady\u201d or \u201cpink hat lady\u201d, and had been the subject of public wanted requests by the agency.Help the #FBI identify this woman who allegedly unlawfully entered the U.S. Capitol on January 6. If you have information, submit a tip to https://t.co/buMd8vYXzH. When providing a tip on any of the below photos, please refer to photograph 110. https://t.co/QkV52OYdZ2 @FBIWFO pic.twitter.com/iANB6bZ96zShe also recently featured in a piece by the New Yorker where she said: \u201cI was not part of a plot\u2014organized, whatever. I have no military background. . . . I\u2019m a mom with eight kids. That\u2019s it. I work. And I garden. And raise chickens.\u201dThe CBS report this morning says:Agents swarmed the house searching for any evidence to help build a case against Powell and any clues that may indicate where she may have gone. Neighbors say Powell and some of the younger children haven\u2019t been seen for a week or more and are apparently in hiding.Powell can clearly be seen in videos taking a battering ram to the Capitol. She\u2019s become known as \u201cthe bullhorn lady\u201d who seemed to have knowledge of the Capitol building\u2019s floor plan. She was seen on video instructing insurrectionists on where to go. Powell is of special concern to federal investigators because if she had that knowledge, it could indicate the assault was pre-planned.Read more here: CBS News \u2013 FBI raids home of Capitol riot\u2019s suspected \u2018bullhorn lady\u2019 Rachel PowellThe Washington Post have an interesting piece this morning which reflects one of the complexities of the social media environment we live in. Rachel Lerman reports that lawyers for Dominion Voting Systems have asked Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Parler to preserve posts about the company, even if the material was already removed for spreading misinformation. She writes:The posts need to be kept \u201cbecause they are relevant to Dominion\u2019s defamation claims relating to false accusations that Dominion rigged the 2020 election,\u201d according to the demand letters from Dominion\u2019s law firm Clare Locke. Dominion sued Rudolph W. Giuliani and Sidney Powell for more than $1.3 billion each in January, alleging that the lawyers defamed Dominion by saying the machines were used to steal the election from President Donald Trump.Dominion asked each company to keep posts from slightly differing lists of people. Those included right-wing pundit Dan Bongino, Fox News host Maria Bartiromo, MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell and Powell. It also included news organizations Fox News, One America News Network and Newsmax and \u2014 in Twitter\u2019s case \u2014 Trump.Dominion warned in its letters to the social media companies that more lawsuits would be coming.You imagine the situation might be particularly difficult for Parler, which was knocked offline by its hosts in the wake of the 6 January Capitol riot, has only been able to partially restore the service with support from a Russian-owned technology firm, and this week ousted its CEO John Matze.Read more here: Washington Post \u2013 Dominion Voting tells Facebook, Parler and other social media sites to preserve posts for lawsuitsThe US economy added back 49,000 jobs last month as coronavirus restrictions eased and fiscal stimulus from Washington goosed up the economy, the labor department announced Friday.The unemployment rate dropped to 6.3%, down significantly from its pandemic high of 14.7% in April, but big problems remain.On Thursday, the labor department said 779,000 people filed new unemployment claims last week, down from the week before but still close to four times pre-pandemic levels. The latest figures showed some 17.8 million Americans are still claiming unemployment benefits.In December the US lost 140,000 jobs as the latest wave of Covid-19 infections led to more shutdowns across the country and a slowdown in economic activity.The jobs figure come as the Biden administration is trying to push through a $1.9tn stimulus package which would send $1,400 cheques to many Americans and provide fresh aid for struggling businesses. It would also increase the Federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $15 \u2013 the first increase since 2009.The plan has widespread support from voters, with a Quinnipiac survey showing more than two thirds of respondents in favor of the plan. But it has met with opposition from Republicans in Congress, who have balked at the size of the stimulus and proposed a far smaller package. Biden\u2019s plan was approved in the Senate early Friday by a 51 to 50 vote but still faces hurdles and is not expected to become law before mid March.The recovery in the jobs market may embolden opponents but some economists warned that the economic toll of the virus is far from over.Jason Reed, assistant chair of finance at the University of Notre Dame\u2019s Mendoza College of Business, said: \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t forget that the economy is still down about 10 million jobs since the start of the pandemic. We aren\u2019t anywhere close to where we were this time last year.\u201cThe rollout of the vaccine will surely help Americans get back to work, but we shouldn\u2019t expect a return to normal until late 2021 or early 2022.\u201dAn extremely quick and to-the-point snap from Reuters confirms that the House of Representatives will vote today on the final passage of a budget resolution that would allow Democrats in Congress to approve Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package without Republican support. That\u2019s per a Democratic leadership aide.",

    "articles": "And here is Ali Martin\u2019s report on a memorable first day of the series.Joe Root is giving an interview, yet again. \u201cLovely night out with the lads last night,\u201d he says, \u201cBen [Stokes] said some nice words.\u201d Asked about the pitch, he says \u201cit played a lot better than it looked, quite an ugly one. Bounce, a little bit of reverse, really good Indian attack, so it\u2019s important that we make the best of it tomorrow.\u201d That may depend on Ben Stokes and Ollie Pope, and whether they can stay in while scraping off the rust. Root is the third Englishman ever to make a hundred in his hundredth Test, joining Colin Cowdrey and Alec Stewart. Cowdrey did it at the age of 35, Stewart at 37. Root has only just turned 30. He is playing some lovely tunes and has entered what Smash Hits magazine would have called \u201chis imperial phase\u201d. It will be fascinating to see if he can keep it up. Thanks for your company, sorry not to get through all the emails, and we\u2019ll see you tomorrow for the next episode of The Root Show.After all that, you\u2019re probably expecting a match report. And here it is. Warning: it contains the words \u201cwonderful\u201d and \u201cmasterful\u201d in the same sentence. And fair enough: Root, on this tour, is making his way through the thesaurus.The day has belonged to Joe Root, and to Channel 4, who will surely have racked up some handy ratings. And there\u2019s a lot more to come on the telly, as Paul MacInnes reports. And that is that. So the day ends on a sorrowful note for England, but let\u2019s not allow it to take anything away from Joe Root, who has been superhuman on this tour. When he made 228 and 186 in Sri Lanka, it was ravenous batting against a middling attack. Today, he found another level to go up to by adding 128, unbeaten, in his hundredth Test, against Bumrah, Ashwin and Ishant. After spending the whole week talking the talk, he has walked the walk. And on terrestrial TV too. As Alastair Cook says on Channel 4, it\u2019s been \u201can absolutely brilliant innings\u201d.Yes, slamming into leg stump. A great delivery, and a sad moment for Sibley, but he did so well. He gave his all, faced 286 balls, and played his part in a partnership of exactly 200.A superb yorker! This looks out, and is given, but they\u2019re reviewing \u2013 might as well...89th over: England 263-2 (Sibley 87, Root 128) A single to each batsman off Ashwin, and that\u2019s the 200 partnership off 62.4 overs. It\u2019s been slow, then quick, then measured. And magnificent. 88th over: England 261-2 (Sibley 86, Root 127) Bumrah was just changing ends. He gets some lovely lift outside off, but Sibley was never planning to play a shot. He just wants to bat through the day: that hundred can wait.87th over: England 261-2 (Sibley 86, Root 127) Bumrah, despite beating Root twice in two balls, is taken off, to make way for Ashwin. He gets a moral victory too, luring Root into a thick outside edge, but it just trickles away for a single. These two batsmen have now quadrupled the score. And Root celebrates with a six! A slog-sweep, crisply done, although the effort lands him on the deck with another bout of cramp. Stuart Broad trots out with some kind of energy drink, and no doubt berates his captain for leaving him out on a pitch that\u2019s giving the seamers some help. 86th over: England 251-2 (Sibley 85, Root 118) Root, facing Ishant, is still up to playing his favourite shot, the unforced force into the covers, though it only brings a single this time.\u201cAside Root\u2019s serene majesty,\u201d says Guy Hornsby, \u201cwe should also delight in Sibley\u2019s obduracy here too. He had an absolute mare in Galle and rode his luck last dip but he\u2019s been chanceless here, and has really moved well and been rock solid. It\u2019s vital, given how big we\u2019ll need to go here.\u201d Rock-solid, that\u2019s his game.85th over: England 250-2 (Sibley 85, Root 117) Root has cramp, understandably \u2013 he has said that he used to cramp up on getting to 80 in Asian Tests, so this is progress. He plays a pull at Bumrah, gets a thick bottom edge and jogs a single to bring up the 250. Five overs to get through before he has a well-earned bath.84th over: England 249-2 (Sibley 85, Root 116) Sharma to Sibley, which means quite a lot of shouldering arms. There was a danger today that thousands of kids would taste Test cricket for the first time and find that the main ingredient was Sibley leaving the ball. Root\u2019s hundred has made sure there\u2019s something to get excited about instead. And there\u2019s time, just, for Sibley to join him, although he\u2019s probably not remotely fussed. 83rd over: England 249-2 (Sibley 85, Root 116) Back comes Bumrah, and Root, light on his feet, goes deep in the crease to deflect for two. Bumrah finds his radar, gets one to hold its line outside off and beats Root, which is no mean feat at the moment. And then he does it again, with a carbon copy. He could easily have four for 39 by now, rather than just the one.82nd over: England 247-2 (Sibley 85, Root 114) Now Kohli does take the new ball, so perhaps he agrees that it was crazy not to. He hands it to Ishant, who immediately finds some tasty outswing, adding to the feeling that Jimmy Anderson could have some fun here. Root ignores that first outswinger but creams the next one through the covers. Old ball, new ball, seeing it like a football. There\u2019s only one slip and a gully, so even if he does nick it, he may well get away with it.81st over: England 242-2 (Sibley 85, Root 109) So the new ball is due \u2013 and Kohli doesn\u2019t take it. This is either madness or genius. Ashwin, to be fair, finds some lavish turn, though the ball merely misses Sibley\u2019s inside edge and goes for four leg byes. There have been 57 runs off the last ten overs. John Jervis (55th over), your dream is in danger of coming true. 80th over: England 235-2 (Sibley 83, Root 108) Channel 4 are showing the highlights of a memorable innings, but Root is busy adding another one \u2013 an off-drive off the off-spinner, Sundar, which, as Mark Butcher says, anyone else would have played to mid-on with the spin. Root has 37 off his last 31 deliveries, and that\u2019s been against a soft old ball. The new one could go either way. \u201cEngland captain @root66 healthily distracting kids from homeschooling everywhere in the UK,\u201d says Alison Mitchell on Twitter. \u201cin his 100th Test, and in India to boot. It\u2019s an education of its own.\u201d79th over: England 228-2 (Sibley 83, Root 101) Kohli brings back Ashwin, presumably for one over before the new ball. It almost works as Sibley goes down the track and gets in a tangle, but the appeal is stifled.In case you\u2019ve just joined us, here are Root\u2019s scores in the first innings of his three Tests this year: 228, 186, 101 not out. All in Asia, all in the heat, all as captain. Stunning stuff.78th over: England 227-2 (Sibley 83, Root 100) Root drives Sundar down the ground \u2013 but there\u2019s a fine diving stop and he only gets one, to go to 99. The good piece of fielding is followed by a bad one as Sibley sweeps and Gill lets it through his hands, and legs: a double nutmeg. Sibley calmly gives the strike back to Root, who flicks to leg to reach a hundred in his hundredth Test \u2013 and his third in three Tests this year. He takes his helmet off, gives Sibley an illicit hug, and smiles that boyish smile of his, as well he may. Say what you like about lockdown, it has landed England\u2019s best batsman in the form of his life.77th over: England 218-2 (Sibley 76, Root 98) There\u2019s a little corner of Sibley\u2019s psyche that doesn\u2019t entirely fancy this sidekick role. He cuts Shahbaz for four, then tries again, but finds the man at extra-cover. He has 12 off the last ten overs, to Root\u2019s 34.76th over: England 214-2 (Sibley 72, Root 98) Sibley, not to be totally outshone, sweeps Sundar for four, meeting the ball almost as crisply as Root. Then he misses another sweep, prompting an appeal and a brief conference, but they don\u2019t review because the ball pitched outside leg because Sundar is coming round the wicket. Reviewing is one of two things India have done conspicuously well today, along with keeping up the over-rate.75th over: England 209-2 (Sibley 67, Root 98) Root plays a late cut off Shahbaz \u2013 so late that it could almost be a UK government response to the coronavirus. Except that it\u2019s beautiful.74th over: England 205-2 (Sibley 67, Root 94) Sibley brings up the 200 with a flick off Sundar, but he\u2019s just the sidekick now. The star turn is Root, who threads it through the on side for four more, to go into the nineties. And that\u2019s drinks, with Root in full flow and England (whisper it) on top. That said, the new ball is half an hour away, and it will only take a couple of nicks to even things up. Here\u2019s Mike Jakeman, picking up on 9:01. \u201cThe madness in Madras Simon Wilde referred to also saw Kiran Nair make 303*,\u201d he notes. \u201cHas any Test triple-centurion gone on to play fewer matches than his six?\u201d The answer, it seems, is no. But Nair is young enough to come again.73rd over: England 199-2 (Sibley 66, Root 89) Root switches his hands round and plays a superb reverse sweep for four. Shahbaz responds by going over the wicket and bowling into the rough. It\u2019s the first day of the series and Root has already turned Kohli into Nasser Hussain in 2002, desperately ordering Ashley Giles to wheel away outside leg to keep Sachin Tendulkar quiet.72nd over: England 188-2 (Sibley 65, Root 80) A few singles off Washington Sundar, whose bowling has not been half as impressive as his name. He and Shahbaz, on this evidence, are much the same as Jack Leach and Dom Bess, and some way behind Ravi Ashwin. But it is only the first day of the match.71st over: England 185-2 (Sibley 64, Root 78) Root plays his tenth sweep, off Shahbaz, and miscues for the first time, but gets away with it as his top edge comes down in no-man\u2019s-land at deep midwicket. Irritated with himself, he nails the next sweep, picks up four in the same direction, and passes 500 runs in Tests this winter. His scores have been 228, 1, 186, 11 and 78 not out: an extraordinary Joe, flowing like The Don. 70th over: England 178-2 (Sibley 64, Root 71) Root puts on his dancing shoes and meets a ball from Sundar on the half-volley, but only gets a single. A caption tells us that he\u2019s played the sweep shot nine times, connecting with every one, and making 16 runs. 69th over: England 177-2 (Sibley 64, Root 70) For his other young spinner, Shahbaz, Kohli tries a pair of silly mid-offs, standing next to each other like kids in the Under-9s. In an ideal world, one of them would be making a daisy chain.68th over: England 177-2 (Sibley 64, Root 70) England have now seen off Bumrah too. Kohli brings back Washington Sundar, and Root sweeps his first ball for four to overtake Sibley. The gauntlet has been thrown down. Sundar has a leg slip and a silly square leg as Butcher calls it, but they\u2019re not going to stop the sweep, which Root plays again, for two more.67th over: England 171-2 (Sibley 64, Root 64) Root sweeps Shahbaz to draw level again. Sure enough, Sibley darts out of his crease, but succeeds only in turning a length ball into a yorker, which he digs out. \u201cDom Sibley and Joe Root were both teenage prodigies,\u201d says Gary Naylor on Twitter, \u201cbut the transition to full potential has been different \u2013 and we can see it right here, right now. A crisis for Sibley threatened his career; a crisis for Root threatened his conversion rate. It takes all kinds.\u201d A semi-colon and a quote from Fatboy Slim, all in one tweet. 66th over: England 170-2 (Sibley 64, Root 63) Bumrah tries the yorker again, but Root is equal to it. It\u2019s followed by a bouncer, and he copes with that too, playing a careful pull for two, though there\u2019s an inside edge a minute later. Mark Butcher is on commentary, trying to explain the World Test Championship scenario, messing it up, and doing it with such good humour that you don\u2019t mind at all. He\u2019s one of the best TV commentators in England, third only to Mike Atherton and Nasser Hussain.65th over: England 167-2 (Sibley 64, Root 60) Great psychology from Root, drawing level with Sibley, who wants to keep his nose in front. He goes down the track to Shahbaz not once, not twice, but three times, and the middle one brings an on-drive for four.\u201cThird time Sibley has faced more than 200 balls,\u201d says Rory Dollard on Twitter. \u201cBoth previous times he\u2019s gone past 300, made a ton and England won the game.\u201d64th over: England 163-2 (Sibley 60, Root 60) England have again seen off Ishant, who has bowled really well with nothing to show for it but economy (12-2-21-0). Back comes Bumrah, his run ever shorter, his arm ever stiffer, and Root pushes into the covers for four to bring up the hundred partnership. It\u2019s taken 234 balls, and it was just what England needed after losing two wickets for none just before lunch.63rd over: England 159-2 (Sibley 60, Root 56) Better from Shahbaz Nadeem, who manages a maiden. Sibley has now faced 206 balls \u2013 a double Dentury. Joe Denly, eh, those were the days.\u201cNow #seashanties are back in again,\u201d says Miranda Jollie, \u201cI am singing Spanish Ladies along to the cricket. \u2018From Ishant to Sibley \u2019tis 35 leagues\u2019.\u201d Ha. And one of those leagues is the IPL, which you won\u2019t find Sibley in any time soon.62nd over: England 159-2 (Sibley 60, Root 56) Ishant finds some reverse swing, jagging it back into Root, who adjusts and tucks a single. These conditions \u2013 a slow pitch, but enough movement off the seam and in the air even when the ball is in shreds \u2013 are just made for senior seamers. If only England had two of them.",

Rayan Ait-Nouri (abductor), Marcal (groin), Jonny (knee) and Romain Saiss (knock) all missed the 2-1 win over Arsenal and are unlikely to be back in time to face the Foxes, while Raul Jimenez (fractured skull) is a long-term absentee.Wolves provisional squad: Patricio, Ruddy, Kilman, Hoever, Boly, Coady, Semedo, Saiss, Kilman, Neves, Vitinha, Moutinho, Dendoncker, Otasowie, Neto, Podence, Jose, Silva, Traore.As stated previously, Jamie Vardy is available for Leicester after recovering from a groin operation. Boss Brendan Rodgers insists he will not rush the striker back into action but he will be in the squad at Molineux while Wilfred Ndidi (thigh) is a doubt. Wes Morgan (back), Timothy Castagne (hamstring), Dennis Praet (thigh) and Wesley Fofana (thigh) are out.Leicester provisional squad: Schmeichel, Ward, Jakupovic, Justin, Fuchs, Evans, Soyuncu, Thomas, Pereira, Choudhury, Tielemans, Ndidi, Amartey, Mendy, Albrighton, Maddison, Barnes, Under, Perez, Vardy, Iheanacho.Steven Gerrard is raging as Rangers striker Kemar Roofe faces a two-game ban after being handed a notice of complaint following Wednesday\u2019s lunge on St Johnstone\u2019s Murray Davidson.The former Leeds and Anderlecht ace was booked by referee David Munro during the 1-0 Ibrox win after planting his studs into the Saints midfielder\u2019s leg after miscontrolling the ball. But now Scottish Football Association disciplinary chiefs have decided further action is required after Munro reported he did not see the incident in its entirety. Rangers have until Monday to decide with a hearing set for Tuesday.Gerrard is already without Alfredo Morelos for Sunday\u2019s trip to Hamilton after he was charged with a stamp on Hibernian\u2019s Ryan Porteous last week - said: \u201cI\u2019ve just found out literally 10 minutes ago we\u2019ve had a notice of complaint over Kemar Roofe. I haven\u2019t had time to (decide if we will appeal) because the notice of complaint came through 10 minutes ago, which is quite frustrating as we\u2019ve had two sessions to prepare for Hamilton and he has been heavily involved in both sessions. In terms of the decision and what we\u2019re going to do as a club we will deal with it in due course. In terms of the tackle, I haven\u2019t thought that much of it because the referee dealt with it. He was five yards away and he has obviously seen the incident and gave the yellow card.\u201dTalking of Ligue 1, here\u2019s another birthday.\u2764\ufe0f\ud83d\udc99\ud83c\udde7\ud83c\uddf7Join us in wishing @neymarjr a very Happy Birthday! \ud83c\udf89 pic.twitter.com/lpRfQK6lMiPer the Associated PressThe French football league has reached a deal with broadcaster Canal Plus to show matches in the top two divisions for the rest of the season, ending weeks of uncertainty. The LFP said in a statement Thursday that as from the 25th round of matches Feb. 12-14 Canal Plus has exclusive rights for all first-division games and eight matches from the second division. No financial details were given, but French reports said Canal Plus paid \u20ac200m for the rest of the season. The agreement will come as a considerable relief to French clubs starved of ticket sales during the coronavirus, and without TV revenue after a huge deal with Spanish-based broadcaster Mediapro collapsed.Worried, Spurs fans?

Everybody is doing their best' pic.twitter.com/1BaSn0sEmpEverton will continue to be without number one goalkeeper Jordan Pickford in that game with Manchester United. Robin Olsen is set to continue between the posts after an impressive performance against Leeds. Allan is set to return to team training on Friday but will not be fit in time for the weekend, while Jean-Philippe Gbamin also continues his recovery from a long-term lay-off.Everton provisional squad: Olsen, Holgate, Mina, Godfrey Digne, Doucoure, Gomes, Iwobi, Rodriguez, Richarlison, Calvert-Lewin, Keane, Delph, King, Nkounkou, Sigurdsson, Bernard, Coleman, Davies,The Manchester United manager said the 9-0 win against Southampton has barely been mentioned such is the focus on beating Everton on the 63rd anniversary of the Munich air disaster.Well, you\u2019ve got to take the good with the good and the bad with the bad sometimes. What the boys took from that one is that we did the right things, we kept good habits. I don\u2019t think anyone will get carried away with the scoreline because we know we played against 10 men for the full game and of course that\u2019s demoralising when they lose players like they did. When we got the 2-0, the game was more or less over so it was just about doing the right things. We\u2019ve not mentioned the game at all, really. Now all the focus has been on Everton.It\u2019s only the fourth time the game is played on the actual anniversary and it\u2019s important that we put on a fitting performance and hopefully we can honour them with a result. It\u2019s such an important part of our history and the spirit of the club. We have, of course, spoken to the players who\u2019ve come into the club, who\u2019ve not been here and been part of this anniversary. Hopefully we can put a team out that shows the Man United spirit.Solskjaer expects to have Edinson Cavani available for Saturday\u2019s clash with the Toffees, having taken him off at half-time against Saints due to an ankle knock. Eric Bailly is expected to miss out. He has not played for United since the win at Fulham on January 20.Manchester United provisional squad: De Gea, Henderson, Grant, Wan-Bissaka, Williams, Tuanzebe, Lindelof, Bailly, Maguire, Shaw, Telles, McTominay, Fred, Matic, Van De Beek, Pogba, Diallo, Mata, James, Fernandes, Greenwood, Rashford, Martial, Cavani.\"We know we played against 10 men for the whole game.\" #MUFC need more consistency at home but the 9-0 victory over Southampton has helped build habits, says Ole Gunnar Solskjaer. pic.twitter.com/BhQRLQHeBFThe Manchester City striker speaks to Josu\u00e9 Seixas about his early memories of football in Brazil, his greatest moment as a player and the title race.It\u2019s his birthday today, 36.Cosa dire di pi\u00f9 \u2764\ufe0f Auguri, Super Campione!

The Swiss defender tore an anterior cruciate ligament in the victory at Derby in July, which required surgery. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be returning to training on Monday with the team, and as he gains fitness he will start being incorporated with the under-23s,\u201d Bielsa said.Per PA MediaPep Guardiola says he expected better from Jurgen Klopp than to indulge in mind games prior to Manchester City\u2019s trip to Liverpool on Sunday. Liverpool boss Klopp, in referring to City\u2019s postponed game against Everton following a Covid-19 outbreak at the club over Christmas, has suggested Guardiola\u2019s side had two weeks off as a result. The inference was the break helped fuel City\u2019s rise to the top of the Premier League.Guardiola said at a press conference: \u201cHe made a mistake. Jurgen has to see the calendar again. We had Covid, we had one week and we played with 14 players in Stamford Bridge. Tomorrow when I see Jurgen I will ask him how long we had off. I\u2019m surprised, I thought Jurgen was not that kind of manager, I didn\u2019t expect that comment. Maybe it was a misunderstanding.\u201dJos\u00e9 has pursued the old \u201cfootball heritage\u201d line but David Hytner is not convinced. That\u2019s all from me - handing you back to John for more. Bye for now.Jamie Vardy will be back for Leicester v Wolves after a hernia operation.\u201cHe will be available for the weekend,\u201d says Brendan Rodgers. \u201cIt was about trying to fit the operation in at the right time. He\u2019s very fit and he\u2019s recovered very well. He looks fit, strong and available, which is great.\u201dOver in Liverpool, J\u00fcrgen Klopp has been talking, too, as we touched on earlier. Some lengthier quotes below before the champions\u2019 meeting with Manchester City:Klopp hopes to have goalkeeper Alisson Becker, Sadio Man\u00e9 and Fabinho available for the City game after all missed recent matches. \u201cAli feels much better, good enough to have an individual session today and Sadio and Fab will be in parts of team training today,\u201d he said.Regarding the new defensive signings, Ozan Kabak and Ben Davies:\u201cWith our situation we will see who can play again, who can not play again and then we will see,\u201d said Klopp. \u201cIn an ideal world we\u2019d have a few weeks to work on defensive things, especially on organisation. Ben and Ozan yesterday had an analysis meeting where they got shown all the stuff we do usually, like a \u2018centre-half movie\u2019. Today proper session, tomorrow proper session and then we will see.\u201dRegarding the Champions League tie against Leipzig and the fact Liverpool cannot travel to Germany for the match due to Covid restrictions:\u201cWith all the stuff we do I think it would have been absolutely reasonable to make an exception, but I don\u2019t know exactly who decided it in the German government but they said \u2018so far not possible\u2019,\u201d said the Liverpool manager. But maybe it is good to see for German people who are not in the subject, we are not infected. We have the same problems like you have. We know there is another strain but we are really in a bubble and we could play at Leipzig without spreading the virus. Let\u2019s just say that once. But it is like it always was, the rules are rules and we will accept them so I don\u2019t know where we will play.\u201dThe Manchester City head coach Pep Guardiola is chatting to reporters ahead of the Super Soaraway Sunday clash with Liverpool. How is his squad looking fitness-wise? \u201cSergio [Ag\u00fcero], Kevin [De Bruyne] and Nathan [Ak\u00e9] are not available. The rest are fit.\u201dIs this City\u2019s best chance to beat Liverpool, he is asked? \u201cThe game is for tomorrow, to win and three points. It\u2019s not about how many years or centuries and so on ... it\u2019s another football game, from 38 games in the Premier League, it\u2019s one more.\u201dOn the title race, and the idea that Liverpool might be out of it: \u201cI don\u2019t make predictions about the future because I don\u2019t know. To anticipate the future, I don\u2019t have this ability. Maybe one day I will have it.\u201dTextbook straight-bat answers from Pep. You\u2019d hope he could at least slog-sweep one of these questions to mid-wicket \u00e1 la Joe Root. But don\u2019t hold your breath.Wolves manager Nuno Esp\u00edrito Santo speaks to the media before the match with Leicester on Sunday, following their victory against Arsenal:\u201cOf course the confidence and the mood is better. The approach of the game [against Arsenal] was better, but it was a strange game to make a proper evaluation, because of the circumstances and the red cards. But the first half of the game shows we have to compete better in a lot of circumstances so this is what we\u2019ll try on Sunday.\u201dOn Joao Moutinho\u2019s goal: \u201cHis confidence can only get better, it was a fantastic goal, a beautiful goal, and we are delighted.\u201dOle Gunnar Solskj\u00e6r is speaking now, before the match against Everton - first addressing that 9-0 thrashing of Southampton the other night.\u201cYou\u2019ve got to take the good with the good and the bad with the bad sometimes,\u201d says Solskj\u00e6r. (What?? Ed.)\u201cWhat the boys took from that one is that we did the right things, we kept good habits, I don\u2019t think anyone will get carried away with the scoreline, because we know we played against 10 men for the full game, and of course that\u2019s demoralising when they lose a player like they did. When we got the 2-0, the game was more or less over, so it was just about doing the right things. We\u2019ve not mentioned the game at all really, all the focus has been on Everton.\u201d\u201cEdinson [Cavani] should be available, yeah, definitely,\u201d Solskjaer said. \u201cHe got a bad ankle knock there. Eric [Bailly] is a doubt and apart from that everyone\u2019s raring to go.\u201d\ud83d\udcac Ole on the anniversary of the Munich disaster: \"It's important that we put on a fitting performance and hopefully we can honour them with a result.\"It's such an important part of our history and the spirit of the club, it's always been emotional for everyone.\"#MUFC #MUNEVE pic.twitter.com/etm3cALRmmHere\u2019s our match preview for Newcastle v Southampton:From the ever-resourceful PA Sport, some in-depth Mourinho quotes from last night. The Tottenham manager was speaking following defeat by Chelsea. He probably feels like he could use a week lying on a beach drinking cocktails, but instead he has to get his team in shape to face relegation battlers West Brom on Sunday. It\u2019s relentless. Here he is:\u201cI put pressure on myself every day,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cI don\u2019t need others to put pressure on me. I put pressure on myself every day. Every day. So since 2012 without three defeats in a row? But since when without a title? Maybe I can give one.\u201d \u201cThe most important thing now is West Bromwich,\u201d he added. \u201cI don\u2019t even want to think about Everton or about City. I think after City, we go to Austria, again on Europa League, which is a big competition for us, we have good expectations in that competition. But I don\u2019t even want to think about that. I want to think about West Bromwich. That\u2019s a big game. Sometimes big games are just against the top six, or the London derbies. Other times, big games can be games like this. Is a big game for West Bromwich, because they need a victory, they need points, they need to survive. They need to get out of where they are. It\u2019s a big game for us. Because we need to leave the position where we are, which is not a dramatic position like theirs is, but is a very bad position for us, we have to leave it, we need to win, we need to break the dynamic of three defeats like you saw. So it\u2019s a very important match for us. But the reality is that, until the end of the month, we have great motivations in front of us. \u201cEuropa League is something that, since the beginning, we put a lot on. I cannot forget that we had to play how many games to qualify for the group phase, and games with two days in between, travelling around Europe to do it. So we want, the team wants, the team is waiting for that, and maybe the squad needs that. But let\u2019s focus on West Bromwich because it\u2019s the next match and as you say, after three defeats, we have to win against West Bromwich, we cannot even think a different thing.\u201d \u201cBesides being a great footballer, he is a super-nice guy. He is eager to learn, hungry to win, open-minded and he can perform for any manager.\u201dEncouraging words for Mason Mount from the new Chelsea gaffer, Thomas Tuchel, following that win against zombie-Spurs last night. Jacob Steinberg has the story:Team news from Ancelotti ahead of their match against Manchester United on Saturday night.The goalkeeper Jordan Pickford is out injured with an abdominal problem. Ex-Napoli midfielder Allan is back in training as of today but not yet match fit, while Jean-Philippe Gbamin is also nearing fitness but \u2018it\u2019s too early to say\u2019 when he will be back.Ancelotti also that he is planning to rotate his squad for the meeting with title-chasers Manchester United.

Alisson, Sadio Man\u00e9 and Fabinho are all training today. There was a moment of J\u00fcrgen confusion when he was addressed as \u201cJackie\u201d as in Jackie Weaver. He looked completely blank, and the wag from PLP had to explain his joke. He\u2019s no Sean Dyche, is he? And J\u00fcrg clearly isn\u2019t abreast of the goings-on at Handforth Parish Council. Team news for Fulham v West Ham. New signing Josh Maja is expected to be in Fulham\u2019s squad, although he is most likely to come off the bench. Fulham have no new injury concerns, although with the frequency of matches, some players will be assessed on Friday ahead of the game. Defender Terence Kongolo and midfielder Tom Cairney remain sidelined through injury.Provisional Fulham squad: Areola, Aina, Andersen, Adarabioyo, Tete, Reed, Anguissa, Robinson, Loftus-Cheek, Mitrovic, Lookman, Rodak, Hector, Odoi, Ream, Decordova-Reid, Cavaleiro, Lemina, Bryan, Maja.West Ham are almost at full strength with Arthur Masuaku the only absentee. Wing-back Masuaku is recovering from knee surgery but began jogging this week and is about a month away. Jesse Lingard is poised to start again following his two-goal debut at Aston Villa in midweek.Provisional West Ham squad: Fabianski, Coufal, Dawson, Ogbonna, Cresswell, Rice, Soucek, Fornals, Lingard, Benrahma, Antonio, Randolph, Johnson, Fredericks, Balbuena, Diop, Noble, Bowen, Lanzini, Yarmolenko, Odubeko.Team news for that Newcastle v Southampton game. Newcastle face a defensive crisis ahead of Saturday\u2019s Premier League clash with Southampton. Skipper Jamaal Lascelles (hamstring) and Federico Fernandez (muscle) are out, while Paul Dummett (muscle) and Jamal Lewis (hamstring) are doubts and expectant father Ciaran Clark could also miss out.Loan signing Joe Willock is available for the first time since completing his temporary move from Arsenal, while fellow midfielder Matt Ritchie returns to the squad following the collapse of his proposed return to Bournemouth. Christian Atsu has been added to the 25-man league squad as a result of DeAndre Yedlin\u2019s departure for Galatasaray.Newcastle provisional squad: Darlow, Dubravka, Manquillo, Krafth, Lewis, Schar, Clark, Dummett, Shelvey, Hayden, M. Longstaff, S. Longstaff, Murphy, Fraser, Willock, Ritchie, Anderson, Hendrick, Atsu, Almiron, Saint-Maximin, Wilson, Joelinton, Gayle, Carroll.Southampton\u2019s injury crisis appears to be abating slightly, and Ralph Hasenhuttl could have Oriol Romeu and Yannik Vestergaard available. Takumi Minamino could be in line to make his debut after joining the Saints on loan from Liverpool towards the end of the January transfer window, with Shane Long and Yan Valery departing the club on loan.Romeu trained on Thursday, but it remains to be seen whether he will be fit enough, while Vestergaard has a slightly better chance of recovering in time. Alexandre Jankewitz is suspended after his early red card against Manchester United but Jan Bednarek\u2019s dismissal was overturned on appeal.Southampton provisional squad: McCarthy, Bednarek, Vestergaard, Stephens, Bertrand, Romeu, Ward-Prowse, Armstrong, Adams, Ings, Forster, Redmond, Djenepo, Minamino, Ramsay, N\u2019Lundulu, Ferry, Watts, Vokins.Louise Taylor has heard from Steve Bruce this morning and he\u2019s not happy with those suggesting Graeme Jones is around to take his job. Steve Bruce hopes Allan Saint-Maximin might be able to return to his, er, maximum for Newcastle soon as he continues to recover from coronavirus. Southampton are the opposition this weekend. He was idle - I mean really idle, because he had to be - for eight weeks. He\u2019s now had four (lots of) 30 minutes, so we hope he\u2019s as good as he\u2019s going to be. We hope he has the effect on the team that certainly he had when he first came to the club. We know how important having your big players fit is and it\u2019s good to see him back fit because certainly he will give us an edge, which he did do at the start of the season. Certainly we have missed him.Dean Smith is not happy; his Aston Villa team have lost four from their last six Premier League matches. Dean Smith has told his misfiring Aston Villa players they need to raise their game against fellow mid-table battlers Arsenal. Villa have lost four of their last six Premier League outings and host Arsenal on Saturday..The message was they\u2019ve dropped below their standards. We\u2019ve had some very high standards this season already and we keep speaking to the players, if we want to be a top team then we have to keep playing to those standards. For me, there were too many six out of 10s on Wednesday night and if you drop to that level then you\u2019re going to get beat. We found that out. The lads understand that as well and they know what they have to do to put it right. It was the first time I thought we looked mentally tired more than anything, certainly there\u2019s nothing in the numbers to suggest fatigue in any way, but it was the fifth game in 14 days, we\u2019ve got our sixth game on Saturday in 18 days. The lads have to make sure they\u2019re ready for each game because it\u2019s a tough league and can be punishing if you\u2019re not right.A transfer brief: Norwich striker Josip Drmic has joined Croatian side HNK Rijeka on loan for the rest of the season, having not played at all this season for the Canaries. It\u2019s a good thing Sean Dyche is so funny otherwise things could get doomy at Burnley, who have a lengthy injury list. Graham Potter\u2019s Brighton look in comparatively rude health. Per PA Media. Strikers Chris Wood and Ashley Barnes, as well winger Robbie Brady, midfielder Josh Brownhill and full-back Charlie Taylor were all sidelined by a variety of injuries for the defeat to Manchester City in midweek. Dyche does not think any of the quintet will be sidelined for too long, but this weekend\u2019s visit of Brighton may come too soon.Burnley provisional squad: Pope, Bardsley, Mee, Taylor, Tarkowski, Pieters, Nartey, Dunne, Brownhill, Gudmundsson, Cork, Brady, Rodriguez, Vydra, Peacock-Farrell, Lowton, Long, Westwood, McNeil, Stephens, Wood, Barnes, Benson, Driscoll-Glennon, Mumbongo.Brighton will be without Solly March after the winger hobbled off against Liverpool.But boss Graham Potter could welcome back Joel Veltman and Alexis Mac Allister, who both missed the shock win at Anfield. Tariq Lamptey, Danny Welbeck, Alireza Jahanbakhsh and Florin Andone are still sidelined.Brighton provisional squad: Sanchez, Walton, Steele, White, Webster, Dunk, Burn, Veltman, Bissouma, Khadra, Propper, Lallana, Moder, Mac Allister, Alzate, Gross, Trossard, Izquierdo, Maupay, Tau, Zeqiri, Connolly.One swallow doesn\u2019t make a summer, definitely not during a pandemic, but David Moyes has said he might sign Jesse Lingard permanently if he maintains his stunning start to life at West Ham with two goals against Aston Villa on Wednesday. The situation here is Jesse\u2019s going to get a good chance to look at West Ham, see what he thinks of us and whether he likes it, and we\u2019ll get a good look at Jesse and decide what we think in five or six months\u2019 time.Leah Galton has signed a contract extension with Manchester United Women. \u270d\ufe0f We're delighted to announce @Leah_Galton21 has extended her contract with #MUWomen until 2024! \u2764\ufe0fJoe Root is a ton up in his 100th Test, and fellow Yorkshireman Neil Warnock has offered his congratulations.

Quiz!!!All is not well at Ajax. After S\u00e9bastien Haller was mistakenly left out of their Europa League squad comes the news that their goalkeeper, Andre Onana, has been handed a 12-month suspension for failing an out-of-competition doping test, with the club claiming he accidentally took medicine meant for his wife\u2019s consumption. They had hoped for a conditional suspension but the ban is effective from today. The club has released a statement. On the morning of October 30, Onana was feeling unwell. He wanted to take a pill to ease the discomfort. Unknowingly, however, he took Lasimac, a drug that his wife had previously been prescribed.Onana\u2019s confusion resulted in him mistakenly taking his wife\u2019s medicine, ultimately causing this measure to be taken by UEFA against the goalkeeper.Furthermore, the disciplinary body of the football association has stated that Onana had no intention of cheating. However, the European Football Association believes, on the basis of the applicable anti-doping rules, that an athlete has a duty at all times to ensure that no banned substances enter the body.The disciplinary body of the European football association, UEFA, has imposed a suspension of 12 months on Andre Onana for a doping violation.Yes, it had fully evaded my attention until now. Bayern Munich play Hertha Berlin in the Bundesliga tonight, then fly to Qatar to play Al Ahly in the semi-finals on Sunday. Palmeiras, who only won the Copa Libertadores last week, play Tigres UANL, who beat the Korean club Ulsan in the quarter-final on Thursday. Al Ahly beat Al-Dusain - of Qatar and coached by the former Nottingham Forest manager Sabri Lamouchi - on Thursday. Just seen the FIFA Club World cup is currently going on in Qatar. That had passed me by and i thought that would have been cancelled a long time ago but then i realised FIFA..The pub banter king, Sean Dyche, speaking to PA Media, has continued his message that laughter is the best medicine. As yet, he appears not to have commented on the leveraged buyout of Burnley that David Conn helped bring to light in these pages. We\u2019ve had some really tough times; very pressurised, full of anxiety and you\u2019ve got to diffuse that at times. It\u2019s certainly something I\u2019ve believed in throughout my life. The hardest things can find the funniest moments, I don\u2019t mean crass or awkward moments or horrible ones. It\u2019s a deadly serious moment in our world but there still has to be a moment where everyone can relax a little bit. You still have to do the job, no matter who you\u2019re playing against. A bit of humour doesn\u2019t go amiss. I accept humour from the players as well. It\u2019s not a one-way street, they can have the odd flippant or funny remark. Going back to lookalikes, we did have a lookalike board, I\u2019m not going to tell you who was on it but there were some brilliant ones which the players put on themselves. If you try to have a joke or a one-liner or fun about anything, it\u2019s turned around on you, virtually always. It\u2019s a shame but that\u2019s modern life, I get that. Some managers who probably have way more humour - and I know some that are for a fact - they just go \u2018there\u2019s no point because I ended up getting it turned on me\u2019. You\u2019re damned if you do and damned if you don\u2019t. Most managers, in my experience, put a straight bat on it, bat it away and try to not show the truth of who they are.Did we mention that there\u2019s a lot of football on this weekend? That goes for sport too. Paul MacInnes has worked out the schedule. And talking of the Champions League, there\u2019s this riddle to solve. A meeting about this is taking place today, presumably on Zoom. More as and when we get it. West Brom v Tottenham will see the Jos\u00e9 Mourinho charm offensive continue. His team were rotten against Chelsea.The big game, of course, is Sunday\u2019s showdown at Anfield. Here\u2019s what Alex Hess had to say in our 10 things preview, with obligatory Nigel Tufnell quote. Pep Guardiola may be a tactical genius, but as Spinal Tap\u2019s guitarist once said: \u201cIt\u2019s such a fine line between stupid and clever.\u201d The Manchester City manager has proven as much with his tendency to overcomplicate things in big matches. Few know this better than J\u00fcrgen Klopp, whose Liverpool team have more than once been grateful beneficiaries of Guardiola\u2019s needlessly intricate one-off gameplans. There is no call for such complexity on Sunday. City head to Anfield having won 13 games in a row in all competitions, while their opponents have won three of their past 10, lost two on the bounce at home and kept one clean sheet this year. The Anfield crowd, which has in recent years fuelled early blitzkriegs against City, will be absent. Guardiola\u2019s main task may be psychological rather than tactical: to ensure his players take to the pitch with the same freedom of the past two months. Or to put it in plain terms, to avoid messing with a winning formula. Public health warning: there will be no Premier League football on tonight. But titter not, lest you be tittered, it\u2019s back tomorrow and the cold turkey will be brief. There will be aching limbs all round, and a few suspensions too after a few red cards, not all of them rescinded. So, what do we have in store? Saturday\u2019s early game sees Aston Villa entertain Arsenal, with both teams coming off defeats in midweek. At 3pm, Burnley welcome in-form Brighton, slayers of Tottenham and Liverpool in four days. Sean Dyche, the lookalikey banter king, takes on Graham Potter, future England manager. After their *latest* 9-0, Southampton go to Newcastle, who lost to Crystal Palace on Tuesday in a game that already feels a long time ago. A London derby follows that, and it\u2019s Fulham versus West Ham where future Hammers manager Scott E Parker takes on David Moyes, who has found the new Fellaini in Tomas Soucek. Saturday\u2019s fun concludes with Manchester United struggling to score against Everton having used up all their goals against Southampton. Tottenham versus West Brom is Sunday\u2019s midday meeting of the entertainers, followed by Nuno\u2019s Wolves, another team of thrill jockeys, taking on Leicester, who recovered themselves after losing to Leeds last Sunday by beating Fulham. Then comes Liverpool versus Manchester City, a match J\u00fcrgen Klopp may be relying on an outbreak of Cityitis to have any hope of defending the title. Sunday\u2019s late game, Sheffield United versus Chelsea, will see Thomas Tuchel trying to out-tactic Chris Wilder whose Blades have glinted a glimpse of safety. The round of matches concludes on Monday with a discussion of Argentinian literature between Marcelo Bielsa and Roy Hodgson when Leeds play Crystal Palace.",

    "articles": "Ioannina is no Mykonos. A city on the northern Greek mainland near the border with Albania, it is landlocked and rarely on any tourist trail. As far as guidebook mentions go, it\u2019s silverwork, feta cheese and local spring water.But back in spring 1994 it burst on to front pages across Europe, seizing the minds of politicians. Ioannina joined the ranks of little-known European cities to host a European summit and become a household name for a fortnight.From Messina to Maastricht, such places will fill history books of the future as they retrace the story of European integration \u2013 and Britain\u2019s troubled joining and departure.In March 1994, Europe\u2019s foreign ministers, meeting in Ioannina, were arguing about power and who really gets to wield it. The debate was all about the EU\u2019s smaller countries \u201ctaking back control\u201d. The result \u2013 the Ioannina compromise \u2013 was a seemingly arcane technical bargain about voting rights in an enlarged EU, but it paved the way for fewer national vetoes and deeper European integration.Ten years earlier, in June 1985, it was Schengen \u2013 not even a town or city, but a Luxembourg village \u2013 that was on everyone\u2019s lips.With a population of fewer than 5,000, and previously known only for its wine-making, it is close to where the territories of Germany, France and Luxembourg meet. A number of European nations met there to sign the momentous Schengen agreement \u2013 a milestone in Europe\u2019s integration, which abolished border controls over much of Europe.And though most people think it started in 1957 with the Treaty of Rome \u2013 rich with imperial symbolism, surely \u2013 the key breakthrough actually came a few years before, in the more obscure city of Messina, the third-largest on the island of Sicily.Messina kicked off the whole EEC project. However, the British famously didn\u2019t go. Old Foreign Office hands reminisced that was it was \u201ctoo outlandish and far away\u201d to send a UK government representative.Forty years later and over 1,000 miles north, it was another \u201cm\u201d that unexpectedly took centre stage.In the student-filled but quiet medieval town of Maastricht, on the banks of the River Meuse in the Netherlands, European leaders took the huge twin strides of creating the euro and launching a European political union \u2013 creating the treaty that took the city\u2019s name.Imagine how the UK tabloids would have coped if the meeting had been in Berlin.The journey of subsequent European treaties snaked across Europe in a winding path worthy of any student\u2019s interrail ticket \u2013 from Amsterdam to Nice to Lisbon \u2013 each stop a step on the way to more European integration.But these places are synonymous not only with leaps forward in the European project, but also rising arguments over it, as Britain fell more and more deeply out of love with the EU.Dublin \u2013 one of Europe\u2019s smaller capitals \u2013 witnessed one of Britain\u2019s most momentous rows with European leaders. The acrimonious summit held there was Margaret Thatcher\u2019s first, and was dominated by her demands for her money back. As Helmut Schmidt, the then German chancellor, quipped: she had hardly spent a penny and she wanted her pennies back.The row simmered through summit after summit until it was finally defused five years later at Fontainebleau.But perhaps the most poignant is another small French town with an impressive chateau, traditionally the summer residence of French presidents. Britain\u2019s uncomfortable relationship with Europe is symbolised by the rebuff at Rambouillet.In December 1962, the then British prime minister, Harold Macmillan, was doggedly fighting to get Britain into the European club against resistance from the French leader, General De Gaulle.Meeting at Rambouillet\u2019s chateau, Macmillan was bluntly let down by his French counterpart. Realising his plans to get Britain into the EEC were in ruins, Macmillan reportedly left the town in tears, leaving Britain to wait another 10 years.Security concerns and growing workloads mean that more and more meetings are held in Brussels. But the crisscrossing journey to obscure European backwaters will continue without the UK. The decisive meetings on Europe\u2019s future won\u2019t be hosted by Carlisle, Leicester or any other UK town \u2013 but they could be in Belgrade or Minsk.\u2022 This article was amended on 5 January 2021. Schengen is located near to where Germany, France and Luxembourg meet, rather than Belgium, France and Luxembourg as a previous version said.Nigel Gardner is a former European commission spokesman and produced the BBC\u2019s history of Britain\u2019s relationship with the EU.",

    "articles": "By now it is almost received wisdom that \u201cpopulists\u201d (often used as a euphemism for \u201cthe far right\u201d) have ignored the threat of Covid-19, that populists have been the electoral victims of the pandemic, and that the pandemic has exposed the political incompetence of populists in government.Most of this speculation is based on one or two individual cases, most notably the US president, Donald Trump. But he is the exception rather than the rule. In a recent comparative study of far-right parties in the European Union, we found that none of those three assumptions holds up to scrutiny. In fact, there has been significant variety in far-right responses to the pandemic.In contrast to Trump, most European far-right parties were quick to point to the danger of the virus to the point of outright alarmism, although many started to walk that back after the number of cases had peaked, and some even started to spread misinformation. Matteo Salvini and his League party in Italy saw the virus as a major threat, but with time opinions on Covid started to fluctuate. The main reason was that the most affected regions in Italy were governed by the League. Consequently, the party went from Salvini\u2019s alarmist appeals to close the borders and ban the Chinese new year, to claims that the virus was not that bad by the League governor of the hardest-hit province, Lombardy.Many far-right parties in opposition initially criticised their governments for responding too slowly, but quickly became the loudest critics of the alleged \u201canti-democratic\u201d and \u201cunconstitutional\u201d government policies when lockdowns were introduced. For instance, the Alternative for Germany (AfD) argued that freedom of speech was \u201cthe clearest victim of corona\u201d, while the Austrian Freedom party (FP\u00d6) claimed that it had stopped \u201ctotalitarian\u201d surveillance plans.By contrast, far-right parties in government implicated the opposition in spreading the virus or frustrating the national response. For instance, the Hungarian government targeted the mayor of Budapest for mismanaging the situation, while Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki argued that the opposition, \u201cinstead of taking care of peace and helping, threw sand in the modes\u201d.The second misperception is that far-right parties have been the big losers of the pandemic \u2013 recently strengthened by the claim that Trump lost the election because of Covid-19. However, in our study of 31 far-right parties in EU member states, only half lost some support in the first, more acute, coronavirus wave, from mid-March to mid-June. Of the rest, five gained support, and 10 experienced no change in the polls. Moreover, the overall effect was marginal, within 1% on average. Far-right parties have started to lose a bit more during the continuing second wave, although the averages remain small and within the polls\u2019 margin of error.Once again, government status seems to play a role. The far-right parties in control in Hungary and Poland mostly gained in the first wave but lost the most in the second wave. Far-right parties in governing coalitions were initially not affected but have now seen some small losses. And far-right parties in opposition, the vast majority, experienced some small losses in the first wave that have largely disappeared in the second wave.So, did the pandemic expose \u201cthe incompetence\u201d of the far right in power? The European data provides little evidence for this. Countries with far-right governments adopted the strictest measures of all; and while those with far-right parties in coalition took less severe measures, it is hard to assess those parties\u2019 roles. And in terms of cases and deaths per population, the numbers are mostly lower for countries with far-right parties in government or in coalition than for countries where the far right is in opposition.It should be noted that all the countries with far-right government participation are in central and eastern Europe, the region least hit by Covid-19 in the first wave. Still, even here countries with far-right parties in government did slightly better than other countries in the region.In short, much of the public debate about the far right, populism and Covid-19 is wrong. Overall, the far right has not ignored Covid-19, has not been its electoral victim, and has not been exposed as incompetent by the pandemic. While the far right has generally framed Covid-19 and the pandemic in line with its ideology (nativism, authoritarianism, and populism), its policy responses have differed, mainly based on whether they are in government or opposition.More than anything, these findings show that we should stop viewing the European far right through the prism of Trump. The US president is in many ways the exception rather than the rule in terms of far-right politics. And as Trump leaves the White House, far-right parties remain major players in Europe.\u2022 Cas Mudde is Stanley Wade Shelton UGAF professor of international affairs at the University of Georgia; Jakub Wondreys is a PhD student specialising in European politics at the University of Georgia",

    "articles": "Black Lives Matter protests last summer sparked an uncomfortable reckoning for many European nations with a legacy of slavery and colonialism.Excavating this dark history via revised school curriculums and initiatives such as Black History Month is difficult. But it is badly needed, and not just to dispel the self-congratulatory and entirely false narratives about Europe\u2019s \u201ccivilisational\u201d past still being driven by nationalist and populist politicians.The new conversation is urgently required if the EU is to salvage flagging efforts to launch a so-called partnership of equals with African nations. And it is needed, too, if European governments are to put relations with African European citizens on a sounder and more respectful footing.There are encouraging signs. In Germany, BLM protests injected momentum into efforts to change street names with colonial-era or racist references. In France, the armed forces ministry provided local authorities with a guide to 100 Africans who fought for France in the second world war, so that streets and squares may be named after them. President Macron had, in 2019 during a visit to Ivory Coast, denounced the French \u201chegemonic view and the trappings of colonialism\u201d, which he said were \u201ca grave mistake \u2013 a fault of the republic\u201d.In Belgium, authorities responded to protests by removing at least some public monuments to King Leopold II, whose forces seized Congo in the late 19th century and ran an exploitative regime that led to the deaths of millions.And in an unprecedented step last summer, Belgium\u2019s King Philippe, an indirect descendent of Leopold II, wrote to the Congolese president, F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi, to offer his deepest regret for the \u201chumiliation and suffering\u201d inflicted during Belgium\u2019s colonial occupation of the country. The pain of the past, said the king, was \u201crevived by the discrimination that is still all too present in our societies\u201d.They may have been a long time coming, and carry only symbolic value, but such gestures matter.Macron\u2019s recent decision to invite young Africans rather than their political leaders to a France-Africa summit on biodiversity in July and to involve African Europeans in the effort are also steps in the right direction; as are efforts to bring female entrepreneurs, cities and business leaders into continuing African-European conversations.Because Europe and Africa are interconnected and interdependent. They need each other to create jobs and growth on both continents, to ensure a post-pandemic economic recovery and to tackle climate change.The EU remains the leading aid, trade and investment actor across the continent. African exports of raw materials, chemicals and petroleum products, minerals and metals as well as fishery and agricultural goods, continue to be the mainstay of many European industries.Yet, even if Africa\u2019s once dynamic growth rates have been slowed by the pandemic, its economic potential, youthful population and plans to build an African Continental Free Area, (AfCFTA) modelled on the EU single market, will intensify international rivalry and competition \u2013 especially between Europe and China.EU policymakers insist that their policies are better than Beijing\u2019s, and that while China\u2019s investments under the belt and road initiative grab global attention, they are worsening Africa\u2019s already high debt burden and making debt-relief measures even more urgent.African commentators accuse the EU, which makes its aid conditional on human rights and other norms, of harbouring \u201cpaternalistic\u201d attitudes, saying the bloc could learn from Beijing on consulting, informing and working with African states as true equals. They have a point.African Union leaders cancelled a much-trailed online EU-Africa mini-summit in early December at the last minute. That followed the postponement because of coronavirus of a full-format meeting scheduled for October. This can not be brushed off as just another routine diplomatic mishap.It is time to come clean. A reset of this relationship is difficult because many increasingly self-confident Africans are understandably sceptical about Europe\u2019s motives. Africa-Europe relations have for years been marked by an imbalanced donor/recipient relationship, with African governments seeking access to EU trade and aid preferences, while European leaders have cultivated privileged ties with African elites and ignored the needs of the continent\u2019s younger generation. Fortress Europe\u2019s aim to keep out African migrants has added to the mistrust.Tasked with picking up the pieces, Portugal, as current holder of the rotating EU presidency, is hoping it can replicate this year a successful EU-Africa summit it organised in 2007.But times have changed. Geopolitics have become more unpredictable, the uncertainties triggered by the pandemic are countless and more countries, including post-Brexit Britain, are vying with the EU for economic opportunities in Africa.One way forward would be an EU acknowledgment of the damage wreaked by colonialism followed by a recognition by African governments that a new generation of modern European leaders \u2013 as EU council President Charles Michel noted last year \u2013 can no longer be weighed down by the \u201cburden of nostalgia\u201d.A joint statement that admits the missteps of the past but also promises fresh beginnings may not lead to an immediate uptick in EU-Africa relations. But it would represent a very good start.If they are to make good on plans for a fairer revamp of relations with African states, EU leaders must take collective action to exorcise the ghosts of Leopold II \u2013 and those of other colonial \u201cheroes\u201d who trod similar ground.That will mean addressing African grievances over Europe\u2019s role in the slave trade and the crueller aspects of colonial rule, as well as persistent modern-day discrimination, racism and unconscious bias.It will require a change in Europe\u2019s toxic debate on migration, implementation of a new EU anti-racism agenda and stepping up work on \u201cinternational partnerships\u201d to replace the traditional EU policy of aid \u2013 or, as it was known in Brussels until recently, \u201cdevelopment cooperation\u201d, in which outdated white saviour narratives were firmly embedded.Shada Islam is a Brussels-based commentator on EU affairs.

    "articles": "\u201cI am happy to work on the frontline and to see the Canadian medical system function so well,\u201d Alecu M\u0103tr\u0103gun\u0103 wrote in a Facebook post, \u201cbut I am sad that I was vaccinated before my mother, who works in the medical system in Moldova.\u201d M\u0103tr\u0103gun\u0103 is a Moldovan sonographer living in Montreal. His mother is 61 and a paediatrician with more than 30 years\u2019 service under her belt. Yet, he told me, she has no idea when the Covid-19 vaccine might become available for her and for more than 53,300 other healthcare staff in Europe\u2019s poorest country.I had a similar reaction to M\u0103tr\u0103gun\u0103\u2019s about my family in Moldova when I saw a sign at my local London pharmacy as long ago as early December, announcing that the vaccine was on its way. At the time, my grandmother had just recovered and my father was still battling with the effects of the virus.Most western European governments have already vaccinated frontline workers and are moving into the second phase of their rollout, even if production problems are now undermining supplies. Moldova, Europe\u2019s poorest country, has not been able to deliver a single jab yet because it can\u2019t afford to buy the vaccine.The Moldovan government does not expect to receive its first batch of vaccine before the end of February, and even that timetable is uncertain and fraught with bureaucratic delays. Ukraine, Georgia and Armenia are in a similar predicament. This is what the \u201ccatastrophic moral failure\u201d over vaccine distribution, in the words of the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, looks like in Europe.Europe\u2019s most economically disadvantaged countries are relying on Covax, a facility for low-income nations led by WHO in response to the pandemic. The organisation will guarantee free jabs for 20% of a country\u2019s population. As for the rest of the doses they need, these countries are seeking help from richer neighbours. That is hardly the way to solve a global pandemic. In an interconnected world, no country is safe until every country is safe.I\u2019ve been home in Chi\u0219in\u0103u since December, and news of Covid-19 related deaths of family friends, former colleagues, or well-known personalities are a daily occurrence. Indeed, the overall death rate in Moldova rose by 21% between May and December 2020, compared with the same period in 2019.The healthcare system is overwhelmed. One man in his 60s, ill with the virus, had to wait for a free bed for three hours in the courtyard of the hospital in the cold. Last spring, videos of patients in smaller provincial hospitals showed shocking conditions, such as no heating or clean water. In one hospital, a man died in the toilet, and the staff, lacking protective equipment, were afraid to get close to him for hours. Eventually they asked other Covid-19 patients to take the body out and cover it with a blanket.With a population of 2.6 million, Moldova has had just under 157,000 official Covid-19 cases, and more than 3,300 deaths. Yet the real infection numbers are likely to be a lot higher, since the government has only tested between 1,000 and 3,000 people daily, reaching an astonishing rate of 58% positive tests in December. People with light symptoms are often refused tests for weeks. Frontline doctors working on Covid wards are the only medics who are tested. Moreover, while my father and grandmother have both been seriously ill with many of the typical Covid symptoms, their tests came back negative. They were only tested once.The infection rate among medical staff was 25% in May, the highest in Europe, compared with only 12% in neighbouring Romania.The pandemic has shed light on the severe underfunding and poor management of the former Soviet Republic\u2019s overstretched public health services. The longer term effects could prove catastrophic.M\u0103tr\u0103gun\u0103\u2019s case makes plain one of the Moldovan health system\u2019s most chronic ailments: a medical brain drain. Just under a third of healthcare workers are of retirement age. The average monthly salary of a GP is now about \u00a3430, following a 30% increase in 2020. In addition to limited funds, those remaining at home struggle with corruption and the politicisation of hospital management. Many seek better opportunities and fairer systems abroad. Without massive injections of funding and healthcare modernisation,Moldova\u2019s young medics will keep leaving for richer countries, while Moldovans at home will end up with even more substandardprovision.Mass emigration isn\u2019t just a problem for Moldova\u2019s health system: it is probably the country\u2019s biggest challenge. Lacking job opportunities at home or looking for better standards of living in the west, Russia, or Israel, more than a million Moldovans \u2013 myself included \u2013 have left the country. Over the past year, tens of thousands of us who either lost jobs abroad due to lockdown restrictions or are privileged enough to be able to work remotely, have returned home. Yet this reverse migration might be temporary unless the government finally offers some economic support to its citizens.Masks are mandatory even on the streets, social distancing rules are in place and shops measure everyone\u2019s temperature, but not all people obey the government recommendations and vaccine scepticism is anecdotally high, even among health professionals. In surveys, people say they are more concerned with the economic rather than the health crisis: illness does not even make it into the five main worries Moldovans have \u2013 it is topped by the future of their children, high prices, poverty, unemployment and corruption.Throughout 2020, Moldova was one of the few European states that provided barely any financial relief to citizens or small businesses. The consequences could start to bite hard in 2021. Newly elected president Maia Sandu, a former World Bank economist, was inaugurated on Christmas Eve and secured promises from western partners including a donation of 200,000 vaccine doses from Romania and a \u20ac15m crisis grant from the EU.But Moldova\u2019s executive has since resigned, the government lacks a legitimate parliamentary majority and the political class is battling over how to organise snap parliamentary elections while also figuring out how to deliver a mass vaccination programme.The light at the end of our tunnel is not even in sight.Paula Erizanu is a Moldovan writer based in London",

    "articles": "\u201cA few years ago I read about an ill-disciplined team that everybody else in the league refused to play, thus giving them a run of walkover victories. As a result they were promoted and no longer a problem for that division. Any idea who this was?\u201d asks Chris Davis.The anti-heroes of this stranger-than-fiction story are Canelas 2010, who escaped the Portuguese fourth tier with the help of umpteen forfeits during the 2016-17 season. Canelas won six of their first seven games in their regional league, Porto Divis\u00e3o de Elite S\u00e9rie 1. Then, after a series of secret meetings, 12 of the other 13 teams said they would no longer play them. \u201cThey were reported for intimidating opponents,\u201d writes Nicholas Reid. \u201cSome players in the team were apparently members of an FC Porto ultras group.\u201dNot just members. The captain, Fernando Madureira, was leader of the Super Dragons \u2013 reportedly the most feared of the Porto ultras.A YouTube video of Canelas\u2019s zealous approach started to do the rounds, and the story even made the New York Times. The exception to the boycott was CD Candal, who were brave enough not only to play Canelas but beat them 2-0. They further confounded expectations by being the only team to have a player sent off in the game.That was Canelas\u2019s only regular-season defeat. Sixteen of their 24 wins were by walkover, and they finished 25 points ahead of second-placed Rio Tinto. Both went into a six-team mini-league to decide promotion to the third-tier national league.With promotion at stake, the other teams decided to play Canelas. (The last two games of their regular season had also taken place.) In the third game, against Rio Tinto, Marco Gon\u00e7alves was sent off in the second minute for chinning an opponent off the ball and then arrested for breaking the referee\u2019s nose by kneeing him in the face.Gon\u00e7alves took Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s old excuse to a new level by saying he couldn\u2019t remember the incident. He was sacked by Canelas and banned from football for four and a half years. The official breakdown of the ban was \u201cfour years for assaulting a referee, two months for insults and threats, and three months for assaulting an opposition player\u201d. He later received an 11-month jail sentence, suspended for two years.The match was abandoned, with Rio Tinto given a 3-0 win. They boycotted the return game six weeks later, a decision that ultimately meant Canelas were promoted ahead of them. That, as far as we\u2019re aware, was the last of the walkovers. Canelas only lasted a season in the third tier before being relegated, but they were promoted again in the 2018-19 season and are currently in the third tier, top of Campeonato de Portugal S\u00e9rie D.\u201cNewport v Brighton ended at 10.30pm on a Sunday recently, surely the latest a match has ever ended on that day,\u201d tweets Steve Williams. \u201cBut what\u2019s the latest in the evening a domestic match in the UK has ever finished?\u201dWe\u2019ve gone over early kick-offs before (Barcelona v Sevilla, 12.05am was late but technically edged it), but several can beat this \u2026 albeit not on a Sunday. \u201cI was at West Ham in 2015, for the FA Cup tie that Everton lost after extra-time and 21 penalties,\u201d recalls Martin Doyle. A hunt through the archives has the decisive penalty scored at 10.34pm.On Twitter, @rezahardy offers \u201cLiverpool\u2019s 4-3 League Cup win at Aston Villa on 18 December 2002, when the usual 7.45pm kick-off was delayed due to crowd congestion until 9.05pm so the match finished at nearly 11pm. Thankfully Danny Murphy scored a 90th-minute goal or it would have gone into extra-time.\u201dBut we can go later, albeit in non-league. \u201cHow about 11.16pm, for Leamington\u2019s 3-0 win against eight-man Kettering, er, last Tuesday?\u201d suggests Robin Tucker. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, the game didn\u2019t even go to extra-time, it was delayed by floodlight failure.\u201d The full-time whistle came at the mentioned time, rather than the later claim in their highlights package.3\ufe0f\u20e3 3 goals\u2604\ufe0f Goal direct from a corner\ud83d\udd34 3 red cards\ud83c\udf2a Storm Christoph\u274c Floodlight failure\ud83d\udd70 Final whistle at 11:30pmHighlights of our crazy win against @KTFCOfficial are now on @LeamingtonFCTV! Highlights: https://t.co/GNavkpKDYU pic.twitter.com/mu3a2TDfGgWorthy of mention too is this from Jason Jandu. \u201cIn October 1996, an under-21 international between England and Poland at Molineux was delayed until 10pm after a suspect package was found and neutralised,\u201d he mails, \u201cso the match must have gone on until at least 11.45pm.\u201d\u201cThe record attendance at the old Malm\u00f6 Stadion was set in the first match it hosted, Argentina v West Germany in the 1958 World Cup,\u201d tweets Adam. \u201cAre there any other grounds that either never bettered their first attendance or set their record in a match between two sides not from their country?\u201dThere are a few examples, one of them close to home. \u201cThe obvious answer is the old Wembley,\u201d writes Paul Quinton (and others). \u201cThe first event there was the 1923 FA Cup final between Bolton and West Ham. In their wisdom, the FA reasoned that nothing like the then-official capacity of 127,000 would turn up, so it didn\u2019t make it all-ticket. The official attendance was given as 126,047, but some estimates of how many got in vary between 200,000 and 300,000. It wasn\u2019t long before finals were made all-ticket and the capacity was restricted to 100,000.\u201dThe same goes for Sydney\u2019s Olympic Stadium. \u201cThe highest attendance of 104,098 occurred at the first official game, the 2000 final between Cameroon and Spain,\u201d writes Sam Hill. \u201cAfter the Olympics, the north and south stands were removed and the capacity reduced, so the number can\u2019t be broken.\u201dAnd finally to Florida. \u201cOrlando Pride, of the NWSL, set their still-standing record of 23,403 at their first match, in April 2016 at Camping World Stadium,\u201d notes Dave Mellinger. \u201cIn fact, that was the league attendance record until it was eclipsed in 2019 by the Portland Thorns in their newly-enlarged stadium.\u201d\u201cHas there ever been the Saturday night score announcer\u2019s all-time dream result: East Fife 5-4 Forfar?\u201d wrote Hugh McGinley back in 2004.Nearly but not quite, although we possibly prefer what happened. The Fifers visited Station Park during the 1963-64 campaign in the old Scottish Second Division and scored four. Their hosts still won, the final score being \u2026 Forfar 5-4 East Fife. In October 2011, East Fife won a thriller, but only 4-3. Then in July 2018, Forfar won 5-4 again \u2026 in a penalty shootout, after a 1-1 draw in the Scottish League Cup.@TheKnowledge_GU Chelsea\u2019s statement sacking Mourinho was 16 words (from @FootballCliches) - what\u2019s the shortest ever?Post-Lampard sacking - longest serving managers who had a playing career at the club?\u201cWhen reading about two of my passions, football and heraldry (yes, really), I came across a 2015 article in which the York Herald from the College of Arms encouraged English clubs to register their badges and said some might be acting unlawfully otherwise,\u201d mails Rich Booth. \u201cHas any club since registered a badge as a heraldic device, or been penalised for not doing so?\u201dJermain Defoe will be a few months shy of 39 years old in May, when Rangers could potentially be crowned Scottish champions. Has a player ever been older when winning their first ever league title?@TheKnowledge_GU this may have done before but seeing as the Man City game tonight had to be stopped because of fireworks going off next door, what\u2019s the strangest reason for a game being paused/abandoned?Gareth Bale's last 6 goals for club and country have come in 6 different competitions. Is this a record?\u201cThis sounds like boasting from a Rams fan, but Derby\u2019s last three managers (Frank Lampard, Philip Cocu, Wayne Rooney) have a combined total of more than 320 international caps,\u201d boasts Rob James. \u201cCan any other team (club or international) in men\u2019s or women\u2019s football claim to have such a decorated succession of gaffers?\u201dHas any footballer been booked or sent off for a provocative or over-the-top manner of scoring a goal (like stopping the ball on the line and nudging in with their head)?Federico Valverde was awarded the Supercopa\u2019s man of the match, after being sent off for his mesmerising professional foul. But have any players been sent off, scored own goals or committed other misc calamities AFTER being named man of the match? https://t.co/hHSHqHdG3G\u2022 Email your questions and answers to knowledge@theguardian.com or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU.",

    "articles": "Coronavirus has hit the UK hard, with the country recording more than 3m cases and 100,000 deaths linked to the disease.The government figures below include confirmed cases only \u2013 some people who have the disease are not tested.At the start of the pandemic, London bore the brunt of coronavirus\u2019s impact. After that, the centre of the virus shifted northwards and to areas in Northern Ireland before rising again in London and the south-east.Everyday life in the UK has been subject to varying degrees of restriction since March, and various national lockdowns currently apply in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. These regulations are set by the legislative body in each nation so there are local differences.Details of the English lockdown are listed here, Scottish lockdown here, Welsh here and Northern Irish here.Cases in the UK first peaked in early April, before falling in late spring and summer. But they then increased again and passed the earlier peak in September, reaching record levels in January.The number of people in hospital with coronavirus rose sharply after records started at the end of March, peaking in April. That figure has now been rising since September and reached a new record in January.Deaths surpassed their first-wave peak in January, with daily deaths once again standing at over 1,000.Since UK regulators approved the Pfizer vaccine in December, the UK\u2019s vaccine rollout has picked up pace. Hundreds of thousands of people are now being vaccinated every day.The government plans to offer 13.9 million people (21% of the population) a first dose of the vaccine by the middle of February. This group includes the top four priority groups: everyone in care homes, all over-70s, frontline health and social care workers and clinically extremely vulnerable individuals.There have been more recorded cases in the second wave of the pandemic, and this can be partly attributed to increased testing. Many more tests were done in autumn than during the first wave in the spring.In March and April, there were relatively few tests available and these were given to people with severe symptoms \u2013 mainly in hospitals. Most people with milder symptoms were not tested, so these cases were not recorded, meaning the actual number is likely to have been much higher. Sir Patrick Vallance said the daily case number may have been over 100,000 on some days in the first wave.More tests were available during the second wave and the majority of people took tests in the community. This means that people with milder symptoms are now being tested and recorded in the official figures. The real number of cases will still be higher than the recorded count, but the testing will be picking up a greater proportion of the total.However, given Covid-19\u2019s potential for exponential growth, the shape of the cases curve is critically important, and the effect of increased cases can be seen in the hospitalisation and mortality curves above.In the table below, you can find out the number of cases per 100,000 in your area, both for the last week and since the start of the pandemic.This data comes comes from Public Health England, working with devolved authorities in Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland.Differences in data collection and publishing schedules may lead to temporary inconsistencies. 3 and 4 October cases totals include cases from previous days published late owing to a technical fault.The government figures for deaths that are used in this tracker incorporate any deaths that have occurred within 28 days of a positive test. This means that they they are able to quickly capture those deaths occurring in hospitals and care homes, both settings where testing is widespread.The ONS, along with its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland, captures deaths data differently. They count all deaths where Covid is on the death certificate. About 90% of these deaths are directly due to Covid while it is a contributory factor in the remaining deaths.Due to the unprecedented and ongoing nature of the coronavirus outbreak, this article is being regularly updated to ensure that it reflects the current situation as well as possible. Any significant corrections made to this or previous versions of the article will continue to be footnoted in line with Guardian editorial policy.",

    "articles": "Matt Hancock has confirmed a government timetable of early May for all UK adults aged 50 and older to be offered a first coronavirus vaccination, while arguing it is \u201cstill too early\u201d to start talking about an imminent wider reopening from lockdown.The May deadline was one Downing Street had previously declined to specify, and which emerged on Friday seemingly by accident when it was mentioned as part of a government plan for elections in England that month.No 10 had previously said only that the target for offering initial vaccinations to the first nine groups of people, phase 1 of the programme, was \u201cspring\u201d.But a Cabinet Office document published on Friday, setting out plans to hold elections on 6 May, said these could safely happen in part because the first phase of vaccinations would be finished by then.Downing Street initially dismissed the schedule, saying the Cabinet Office report was \u201cissued in error\u201d and had been withdrawn, before saying it was correct after all.Hancock told Sky News: \u201cMy plan is that we should be able to offer the vaccine to everybody in categories 1 to 9 \u2013 that\u2019s all the over-50s \u2013 by May,\u201d adding that \u201clots of things have got to go right to hit that goal\u201d, especially continued supply of vaccines.Confirmation of the timetable prompted immediate demands from some Conservative MPs for an accelerated schedule to end England\u2019s lockdown.Mark Harper, the former chief whip who chairs the Covid Recovery Group, which groups together about 70 Tory backbenchers, said if the first vaccination phase was completed by May, it would be \u201calmost impossible to justify having any restrictions in place at all by that point\u201d.\u201cOnce the top four risk groups have been vaccinated by 15 February, and protected by 8 March, the government must start easing the restrictions,\u201d Harper said, adding that ministers should also look at fully reopening schools before March.But Hancock urged caution, pointing to the fact that more than 30,000 people were still in UK hospitals with Covid, and calling that \u201cfar, far too many\u201d.Asked about a rapid easing of lockdown, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s still too early to say,\u201d adding: \u201cI know there\u2019s good news out there, but we still have very serious problems that we\u2019ve got to get through.\u201dWhile the expected timetable for people to be offered vaccinations is of intense interest to the public, Downing Street had been wary of committing to schedules beyond the target of offering first vaccinations to all older care home residents and staff by the end of January \u2013 which was largely met \u2013 and to have done the same for the first four most vulnerable groups, as far as those aged 70-plus and clinically extremely vulnerable people, by mid-February.One reason for caution was the sense inside No 10 that Boris Johnson has previously overpromised in terms of timetables for a return to more normal life.Another caveat is that while the current speed of vaccinations is sufficiently fast to meet the May deadline \u2013 more than 2.5m doses have been delivered in both of the last two weeks \u2013 this is dependent on a continued supply of vaccines.The ambiguity created some confusion, with Downing Street repeatedly declining over recent days to specify a deadline. The inclusion of May in the elections plan appeared to catch No 10 off guard. Johnson\u2019s deputy spokesperson initially said of the document: \u201cThis was issued in error, and I believe the Cabinet Office have now withdrawn this.\u201dSeveral minutes later, he corrected himself, saying: \u201cIt isn\u2019t actually being withdrawn.\u201d He then conceded: \u201cThe Cabinet Office document is correct \u2013 what it says is correct \u2013 and the prime minister will set out more details on 15 February.\u201d",

    "articles": "Here the latest developments at a glance:That\u2019s all from me, thanks for following along and writing in. This blog will close shortly.The government\u2019s top scientific advisers warned last month that a \u201ccomplete, pre-emptive closure of borders\u201d was needed to fully prevent new coronavirus strains being imported into the UK. PA reports:Minutes from a meeting of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) held on 21 January revealed that the experts said the only other method of stopping any variants arriving was for all travellers to be quarantined in designated facilities. Prime minister Boris Johnson announced six days later that only people arriving from countries on a \u201cred list\u201d will be required to self-isolate in a hotel for 10 days. It was confirmed last night that this policy will not come into force until 15 February. The advisers stated: \u201cEvidence from the continued spread of the South African and UK variants suggests that reactive, geographically targeted travel bans cannot be relied upon to stop importation of new variants once identified, due to the time lag between the emergence and identification of variants of concern, and the potential for indirect travel via a third country.\u201d They added that requiring passengers to quarantine on arrival and test negative for coronavirus before they are released has the \u201cmost substantial potential effect on reducing the risk of infected arrivals\u201d. On Tuesday, the prime minister\u2019s official spokesman said Sage \u201cdid not actually advise the government to completely close borders or call for a blanket quarantine on travels\u201d. Various MPs have repeatedly called on the government to publish the scientific evidence for keeping the borders open.Last week, Alistair Carmichael, the MP for Orkney and Shetland, urged home secretary Priti Patel in the Commons to \u201cbolster public confidence in her decision making by publishing the evidence\u201d that informed the government\u2019s hitherto introduced measures on Covid border safety.Patel replied: \u201cThroughout the pandemic, all decisions have been made by looking at scientific advice, and [Carmichael] will be well aware of that, and it is no different when it comes to protective measures at the border.\u201cHe heard me speak about shutting the border when the mutant strain from Denmark was prevalent, and taking action around flights from South Africa and other countries, which was absolutely right. That was based on scientific advice, much of which has also been put out in the public domain.\u201dThe outcomes of targeted tests to track the South African coronavirus variant in England could take up to two weeks, public health officials have said. PA reports:Any positive results will be sent for genome sequencing to identify the variant - a process which usually takes around a fortnight. But Public Health England said the most recent tests rolled out in a number of areas of the country this week will be prioritised in a bid to speed up the process. Door-to-door testing as part of urgent efforts to swab 80,000 people came after eleven cases of the variant were identified in the previous few days in people who had no links to travel - suggesting it may be spreading in communities. Testing of around 10,000 people in the Maidstone area of Kent, which began on Tuesday, was completed on Thursday night. Testing in Woking, Surrey was expected to finish on Friday. Sefton Council said efforts to identify the variant in the Norwood area of Southport in Merseyside would continue into the weekend. The testing in Broxbourne, Hertfordshire, is being rolled out for another week until February 12, the council said. Hundreds of test kits were given out in Tottenham, north London, when the testing rollout began there on Thursday and will continue into next week, a spokesman for Haringey Council said. He added that \u201cfeedback has been really positive from residents\u201d. A West Midlands Combined Authority webinar was told on Friday that around 10,300 people in Walsall have been tested so far and some 560 tests had been conducted in the affected areas in Birmingham, with extra capacity being added in a two-week testing blitz. Mobile testing units and home testing kits were also deployed this week to Hanwell, west London and Mitcham, south London. Young people are at risk of becoming unemployable and turning to crime amid partial school closures and rising joblessness, in a spiral that could lead to social unrest, the crime commissioner for England\u2019s second biggest force has warned.Covid was \u201coiling the wheels of violence\u201d, David Jamieson, the police and crime commissioner (PCC) for the West Midlands, said in an interview with the Guardian.\u201cI think we\u2019ve got a tsunami, which we\u2019re holding back at the moment. If we don\u2019t address the issues of people coming off furlough and then just having nothing they can see as their future, we are in trouble. I think it will eventually result in some sort of social unrest.\u201dJamieson added: \u201cWe\u2019ve virtually gone now a year that some children have not really experienced schooling. Some may not want to go back to school after this, and that group of people are going to go through life probably unemployable \u2026 And that group of people is going to lose it.\u201dMy colleague Jessica Murray reports.Coronavirus mutations similar to those in the UK variant could arise in cases of chronic infection, where treatment over an extended period can provide the virus multiple opportunities to evolve, scientists say. PA reports:A team led by University of Cambridge researchers observed the virus mutating in the case of an immunocompromised patient treated with convalescent plasma. They saw the emergence of a key mutation, also seen in the new variant, that led to the rapid spread of the virus before the country was forced into lockdown in January. But there is no suggestion the variant originated from this patient. However, the researchers say the effect they observed is unlikely to occur in patients with functioning immune systems. Using a synthetic version of the virus spike protein created in the lab, researchers showed that specific changes to its genetic code - the mutation seen in the B117 UK variant - made the virus twice as infectious on cells as the more common strain. As the coronavirus replicates itself, its genetic code can be mis-transcribed, leading to errors, known as mutations. Mutations that might change the structure of the spike protein, which sits on the surface of the virus, are are of particular concern. UK researchers within the Covid-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) Consortium have identified a particular variant of the virus that includes important changes that appear to make it more infectious. The health secretary said there were no current plans to roll out vaccine passports for those who had received both jabs. Pressed on the matter by broadcasters, Matt Hancock said: At the moment we have no plans for vaccine passports - and, anyway, going on holiday is illegal in this lockdown. Of course, we\u2019re constantly working with other countries and we keep these sorts of things under review, but for now there are still 31,670 people in hospital with Covid right now. It\u2019s imperative, that even with the good news on the vaccine and even with cases starting to fall, it\u2019s imperative that everybody follows the rules and stays at home unless you absolutely have to leave. I know there is good news out there but we still have very serious problems that we\u2019ve got to get through. Health secretary Matt Hancock said it was \u201ctoo early\u201d to decide whether restrictions could be partially lifted in March as the NHS is still under pressure. Asked what may be able to open in March, he told a pool of broadcast reporters on Friday:It is still too early to say that ... even though the vaccine programme is going great guns \u2013 almost 11 million people now have been vaccinated. It is still too early to say and 31,670 people in hospital with Covid as we speak right now \u2013 that is far, far too many. The NHS is still under pressure and we\u2019ve all got to do our bit to keep those case rates coming down.Hancock said the government would be \u201cvigilant\u201d about which countries would be subject to the forthcoming hotel quarantine rules. Asked whether it needed to go further and expand the current \u201cred list\u201d, the health minister said: We\u2019ll be vigilant in making sure that the hotel quarantine that we\u2019re introducing applies to the right countries where we see these new variants. We have a programme to have surveillance right across the world, working with international partners to make sure we can spot where these new variants pop up, like Brazil and South Africa that we\u2019ve seen so far, and make sure that we can keep people here safe with the new hotel quarantine. The temporary mortuary set up at Birmingham airport has reopened due to a rise in Covid-19 deaths, West Midlands police said. PA reports:The facility, which originally opened in April last year, closed in September as coronavirus deaths reduced. But the force said as infections rates have increased and hospital admissions have risen, the mortuary is reopening to take pressure off the NHS and relieve storage at hospitals. Senior coroner Louise Hunt said: \u201cOur thoughts are with all those who have lost loved ones at this difficult time. I want to stress that dignity and respect for the deceased and the bereaved continues to be our primary consideration. \u201cThe reopening of the temporary mortuary will not impact on our ability to provide the right level of service to all families and we remain focused on the humanitarian and faith needs of all those involved. \u201cWe will continue to review the need for the temporary mortuary weekly.\u201d This just in from Sky News\u2019 Aubrey Allegretti:Matt Hancock in broadcast pool confirms: \"My plan is that we should be able to offer a vaccine to everyone in categories 1-9 - that's all the over 50s - by May. \"Lots of things have got to go right to hit that goal, especially supply which is the rate-limiting factor.\"The UK reported 19,114 new cases on Friday, slightly down from yesterday\u2019s 20,634.The government announced a further 1,014 people had died from Covid-19.Yesterday, a further 915 deaths had been reported.Tributes have been made to a 29-year-old healthcare assistant who died with Covid-19 after giving birth to her fourth child. Becky Regan, who worked at North Tyneside hospital from January 2020, was remembered by family and colleagues on Friday with a one-minute silence. PA reports:In a statement, James Mackey, chief executive of Northumbria hospitals NHS trust, said: \u201cIt\u2019s with deep sadness that we mourn the loss of one of our own team who has tragically died this week. \u201cThis will be remembered as a very sad day for Northumbria and we are all devastated at the loss of our friend and colleague. Our deepest condolences are with the family at this tragic time. \u201cWhile every death during this pandemic has been a tragedy, the loss of Becky will feel especially painful having just given birth and her close family are now dealing with the worst possible news. \u201cOur thoughts are also with her close colleagues and those who treated her during her illness who will also be grieving her loss.\u201d A GoFundMe page was created by family and friends in January, while Regan was in hospital, to help her children. The fundraising page has reached over \u00a39,000. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan has written to education minister Gavin Williamson to urge him to reinstate special funding for London universities worth \u00a364 million which the government has withdrawn as part of a stated commitment to rebalance education spend towards other regions. A 2019 report by KPMG for the Department for Education suggested that higher education costs 14% more to deliver in the capital. Khan stated in the letter: Your letter has let slip the government\u2019s mask on this \u2013 that the levelling up agenda is actually a front for levelling down London.Levelling up is a critical challenge within London as it is across England as a whole. Our city is grappling with deep and entrenched inequalities.Mark Harper, who chairs the Tory MP lockdown-sceptic Covid Recovery Group (CRG), said it would be \u201calmost impossible\u201d to justify keeping restrictions in place beyond 6 May, given the most vulnerable will have been vaccinated by then.The former minister said: It\u2019s great news that the local elections are going ahead on May 6 and that all over-50s will have been offered a chance to have had their all important first jab, providing the bulk of the protection against Covid, by that date too. These top nine groups account for around 99% of those that have died from Covid and about 80% of hospital admissions. It will be almost impossible to justify having any restrictions in place at all by that point. He said lockdowns and restrictions cause \u201cimmense harm to people\u2019s health and livelihoods\u201d, and that by 8 March, when the most vulnerable in the top four priority groups were likely to have a high level of immunity from their vaccinations, the government \u201cmust start easing the restrictions\u201d. He added:Given that Scotland and Wales have indicated that schools will start to open from 22 February, we need to know why English schools need to be kept shut for longer given the great news about the vaccination rollout and the impact every day outside the classroom and the playground has on children\u2019s prospects, education and social development.A further 537 people who tested positive for coronavirus have died in hospital in England, bringing the total number of confirmed deaths reported in hospitals to 74,786, NHS England said on Friday. Patients were aged between 15 and 100. All except 21, aged between 45 and 98, had known underlying health conditions. The deaths were between 17 December and 4 February, with the majority being on or after 1 February. There were 44 other deaths reported with no positive Covid-19 test result. The Oxford team said researchers in South Africa were still looking at how effective the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine is against the strain first detected there, and also being spread in the UK. PA Media reports:Details of these studies will be published in due course. Mene Pangalos, executive vice-president of biopharmaceuticals research and development at AstraZeneca, said it would not be surprising to see reduced efficacy against this variant. He explained: \u201cI think it\u2019s reasonable to say that what we know from other vaccines is we\u2019re not going to be surprised to see reduced efficacy. \u201cBecause we\u2019ve seen from the J&amp;J vaccines and from the Novavax vaccines that these variants do impact - at least in mild and moderate disease, or mild disease - efficacy. \u201cI think it\u2019s to be expected there\u2019ll be reduced activity.\u201dNational Education Union (NEU) Cymru\u2019s senior Wales officer Gareth Lloyd said education minister Kirsty Williams had taken a \u201csensible approach\u201d in allowing a flexible return for pupils aged between three and seven after half term. Lloyd said: We have been clear, we believe that at least three planning days should be used after half term, with no learners in school, to give time for educators to help make the necessary plans for a safe return. Our members want a wider return in a safe working environment and we are expecting discussions next week with Welsh Government to ensure robust mitigation measures are put in place.Dilwyn Roberts-Young, general secretary of the UCAC teachers union, said: We welcome the announcement of mitigating measures to further reduce risks, including regular testing for staff and investment in equipment and modifications.However, the genuine concerns of teachers in the foundation phase about this return must be acknowledged. We urge local authorities and schools to take the local context into account in making their plans and encourage all concerned to consider a gradual, flexible return. Laura Doel, director of school leaders union NAHT Cymru, said members were \u201cbitterly disappointed\u201d the decision had been imposed \u201cwhilst there are too many questions left unanswered\u201d. She said: We have not been provided with the rationale for this decision or definitive scientific evidence to support what we consider to be the rushed and premature wider reopening of schools. More on the vaccine passports the government may not be working on rolling out currently, but potentially later, the former health secretary Jeremy Hunt said on Friday having coronavirus immunity passports was a \u201cvery sensible policy\u201d and that other countries had shown how such schemes can work\u201d. Hunt told BBC Radio 4\u2019s World At One:I think it is a very sensible policy and I know that the government is looking at how that might work.You need something that shows whether someone has had a vaccine and whether they have been tested recently. And I think other parts of the world have shown how these schemes can work quite effectively. Meanwhile, Jim McMahon, Labour\u2019s shadow transport secretary, said: Our priority at the moment must be to secure our borders against the threat of a mutation to the Covid that would undermine the vaccine. Labour will look at proposals around helping to allow people to travel safely, but this must be led by the science. A third review into the link between vitamin D and Covid has been ordered by the UK health secretary as more studies suggest that having low levels of the \u201csunshine hormone\u201d raises the risk of death.Matt Hancock has again asked the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), which sets NHS England clinical guidelines, and Public Health England (PHE) to \u201cre-review\u201d their prior appraisals, after the authorities began \u201cencouraging\u201d people to take vitamin D supplements rather than merely \u201cadvising\u201d it.Nice has twice said there was not sufficient causal evidence to support the use of vitamin D in high doses in hospitals to treat or prevent the respiratory illness.My colleague Mattha Busby reports.I\u2019m Jedidajah Otte and am now taking back over for the next few hours.

    "articles": "With the discovery of new coronavirus variants in parts of the UK, prompting intensive testing, we take a look at what the variants are and how concerned we should be.The terminology around viruses can be confusing, and certain terms are still debated among experts. But the general picture resembles a set of nested dolls.\u201cYou have got the coronavirus family and one strain is MERS, one strain is Sars-CoV-1, one strain is Sars-CoV-2 and another strain would be OC43 \u2013 one of the common colds,\u201d said ProfLawrence Young, virologist and professor of molecular oncology at the University of Warwick.Each strain, said Young, encompasses a number of variants. These variants differ by the set of mutations they contain \u2013 in other words the changes in their genome.Some of these mutations are \u201csilent\u201d \u2013 in other words they have no effect on the way the virus functions, but others can be important, for example changing parts of the virus that affect how easily it spreads between people. Different variants have a different collection of mutations, but they may have some changes in common with each other.While the word variant could be applied to any mutant form of the same strain, experts say the term has come to mean something different.It is a nuance that caught out Nadhim Zahawi, the UK vaccines minister, who said on Wednesday there are 4,000 variants across the world.\u201cThe vaccine minister is not referring to variants as we have come to know them, rather he is referring to individual mutations,\u201d said Prof Ravi Gupta, professor of Microbiology at the University of Cambridge.\u201cThe number of mutations has little actual relevance as many mutations emerge and disappear continuously. Scientists are using \u2018variants\u2019 to describe viruses with mutations that are transmitting in the general population \u2013 there aren\u2019t 4,000 of those.\u201dIn the UK, all eyes are on a handful of new variants of the coronavirus Sars-CoV-2, commonly known by the locations in which they were first detected. At present, key variants of concern are the South African variant (501Y.V2), the Brazilian variant (P.1) and the Kent variant (B117).These variants contain a range of mutations \u2013 some of which are worrying. Both the South African variant and the Kent variant contain a mutation called N501Y, which is believed to make the virus more contagious than older variants.The South African variant also contains mutations known as E484K and K417N, which appear to make the virus better able to evade neutralising antibodies produced by the body, suggesting current Covid vaccines will prove less effective against this variant. The Brazilian variant also contains E484K and N501Y as well as another mutation of concern called K417T.This week it was revealed that the E484K mutation has also emerged in the Kent variant \u2013 although this has only been detected in a small number of cases so far.Experts say the development is not surprising, noting that some parts of a genome are more prone to mutation, while similar mutations would be expected to crop up when the virus experiences similar evolutionary pressures.\u201cThere is selection going on for better viruses, viruses that are fitter for either transmissibility and/or immune evasion, and it is not surprising to see common changes occurring during that selection or adaptation process,\u201d said Young.Deenan Pillay, a professor of virology at University College London said the E484K mutation was a good example of this. \u201cThe fact that there is this common convergent evolution, it means that this is a common way in which the virus can escape the antibodies that are currently circulating, either from previous infection [or through vaccination],\u201d he said.Some mutations result in variants of concern \u2013 for example the higher transmissibility of the Kent variant is believed to be one factor behind the rapid uptick in infections in the UK this winter, while mutations that help a variant to evade neutralising antibodies might affect how much protection current Covid vaccines can provide.There is also a concern, said Young, that the emergence of different variants may increase the chance of someone getting Covid a second time.However, there is a flipside: known mutations make it easier to predict how a new variant might behave, while it also means vaccines can be tweaked to take into account common new mutations and boost protection against several new variants at once.And there is more. \u201cAs the virus becomes more adapted to us, and more transmissible, it might cause less disease, not more disease,\u201d said Young, adding that has been found to be the case with some other viruses.Lab tests involving the Pfizer /BioNTech and Moderna vaccines \u2013 both of which have been licensed in the UK \u2013 have suggested that jab might have a slightly lower efficacy towards the South African variant than older variants.Meanwhile, results from the Novavax Covid vaccine trials, involving two shots of the jab, found that vaccine had 95.6% efficacy against the original coronavirus, 85.6% against the Kent variant and 60% against the South Africa variant. The single-shot Janssen vaccine from Johnson &amp; Johnson also had a reduced efficacy against the South Africa variant, but still offered 57% protection against moderate to severe Covid infection 28 days after vaccination.\u201c60% is what you get with the annual flu jab,\u201d said Young, adding that is still a good level of protection. \u201cI don\u2019t think we should be panicking as much as people are at the moment about it actually.\u201dPillay added that many Covid vaccines target the spike protein, which sits on the surface of the coronavirus. Crucially, he said, the antibodies generated in response to the vaccine target many different parts of this protein, meaning a change in one region as a result of a mutation would be unlikely to mean the variant can evade all the different antibodies.But as more mutations accumulate, it is possible vaccine efficacy could fall further. Scientists are working towards developing new versions of Covid vaccines tweaked towards new variants, with one possibility that vaccines could be targeted at more than one type of the spike protein.Young said another approach would be to create vaccines that target several different parts of the virus \u2013 not just the spike protein on its surface.Pillay said while variants are often linked to particular locations, that did not mean that is where they arose. \u201cWherever there are a large number of infections and you are sequencing them, you are going to find [these new variants],\u201d he said.Stopping the emergence of new variants is no mean feat. \u201cThe only way you can stop new variants is by stamping out the virus because the more the virus is allowed to spread \u2026 the more chances it has to evolve and form new variants,\u201d said Young.That, he said, means getting vaccines into arms, while also sticking to other measures to prevent spread, including social distancing.Pillay added that a well functioning test, trace, isolate and support system was also crucial, as were measures at the borders. \u201cYou need to close the borders, absolutely, to stop these [variants] spreading across borders,\u201d he said.",

    "articles": "The Covid vaccine developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca is nearly as effective against the Kent variant as it is against older forms of the virus, according to preliminary research results.Researchers analysed swabs from trial volunteers who developed asymptomatic or symptomatic infections to determine which variant of the virus they had caught after receiving the vaccine or a control jab.In a preprint under review at the Lancet, the scientists reported that levels of neutralising antibodies \u2013 those that wipe out the virus \u2013 were nine times lower in vaccinated people who caught the Kent variant, named B117, compared with those who contracted older variants.But the reduced antibody response was associated with only slightly lower protection against symptomatic infections with the Kent variant, the scientists said. Among the small number of people included in the study, vaccine efficacy fell from an average of 84% against older variants to 75% against the Kent variant.Despite the fall, the protection against what is now the dominant variant in the UK remains substantially above the 50% threshold the World Health Organization set as the pandemic took hold.The latest results are drawn from swabs taken between 1 October 2020, about two weeks after the first known case of B117 infection was detected in Kent, and 14 January. By that time the more transmissible variant had spread rapidly from Kent, London and the east across the rest of the country.The findings are the first to examine how well the Oxford vaccine, known as ChAdOx1, protects against the variant, which is one of a number of mutated forms of the virus causing concern around the world. B117 is about 50% more transmissible and perhaps 30% more deadly than older variants, though work is ongoing to confirm its lethality.Of more concern are new variants first discovered in South Africa and Brazil, which both bear a mutation called E484K. Early studies suggest the mutation may help the virus to evade immunity induced by vaccines and past Covid infection. The E484K mutation recently appeared among B117 variants, prompting fears the virus could become harder to control.Andrew Pollard, a professor of paediatric infection and immunity, and chief investigator on the Oxford vaccine trial, said: \u201cOver the last couple of months we\u2019ve seen very similar efficacy of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine against the B117, UK, or Kent variant, very similar to the original virus that was circulating last year.\u201dCountry\u00a0US/GermanyEfficacy 95% a week after the second shot. Pfizer says it is only 52% after the first dose but the UK\u2019s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) says this may rise to 90% after 21 days.The UK has ordered 40m doses and is rolling them out nowDoses Clinical trials involved two doses 21 days apart. The UK is stretching this to 12 weeks.Country\u00a0UKEfficacy 70.4% 14 days after receiving the second dose. May have up to 90% efficacy when given as a half dose followed by a full dose. No severe disease or hospitalisations in anyone who received the vaccine.\u00a0The UK has ordered 100m doses and has begun distributionDoses\u00a0Two, four to 12 weeks apartCountry\u00a0USEfficacy Phase 3 trial results suggest an rating of 94.1%.The UK has ordered 17m doses, to be delivered in March or AprilDoses\u00a0Two, 28 days apartCountry\u00a0USEfficacy\u00a0Phase 3 trials suggest 89.3%.60m doses ordered by the UK, with distribution expected principally in the second half of the yearDoses\u00a0TwoCountry\u00a0USEfficacy 72% in preventing mild to moderate cases in US trials but 66% efficacy observed in international trials. 85% efficacy against severe illness, and 100% protection against hospitalisation and death.30m doses ordered by the UKDoses: One, making it unique among Covid vaccines with phase 3 results so farThe data is preliminary and involves swabs from only 499 trial volunteers. Of 1,524 positive nose and throat swabs collected from the participants, 323 swabs from 256 people yielded virus that was identified by genetic sequencing.Further analysis revealed that those who received the Oxford jab but still became infected shed the virus for a shorter time and had lower viral loads than those in the control group. The findings may help to explain why the vaccine appears to reduce transmission by as much as two-thirds after the first shot.Danny Altmann, a professor of immunology at Imperial College London, said the findings were positive. \u201cBy any standards this is very good news as the B117 variant with its increased transmission had the potential to derail our planned timeline for recovery.\u201cThis variant has been thought of as mainly facilitating transmission rather than evasion of immunity \u2013 the prediction from antibody neutralisation tests in the lab had been that the vaccine would still be protective. However, there\u2019s a big gap between showing this in the lab and showing actual protection in the population. We still need to worry about the other variants with the E484K mutation, as in the South Africa variant and the new mutation in the UK. That\u2019s the one where we really need a keen eye on how well the vaccines work,\u201d he said.Sarah Gilbert, a professor of vaccinology and chief investigator on the Oxford vaccine trial, said the team\u2019s platform technology allowed them to quickly update the vaccine to target new variants should that become necessary. \u201cWe don\u2019t expect to go through the full process of clinical trials again,\u201d she said. \u201cWe will be talking to regulators about the exact procedure that we\u2019re going to be going through for using these updated vaccines, but there\u2019s precedent from flu vaccines. This is done every year for flu vaccines.\u201dThe results came as the UK government announced a partnership with the vaccine manufacturer CureVac to rapidly develop vaccines against new variants. The government has placed an initial order for 50m mRNA vaccines from CureVac to be delivered later this year if needed. Almost all of the vaccines developed by the partnership will be versions of an existing jab CureVac has in phase 3 clinical trials.",

    "articles": "Psychologists are reporting a rise in \u201cpandemic burnout\u201d as many people find the current phase of lockdowns harder, with an increasing number feeling worn out and unable to cope.They warn that many are finding the latest lockdown more difficult because of a realisation that coronavirus will be around longer than expected, dashed hopes about an easing of restrictions, and a period of sustained stress similar to overwork, which has prompted symptoms such as fatigue.Data also indicates people are finding it harder to stay positive, with 60% of people in the UK saying they are finding it harder to stay positive daily compared with before the pandemic \u2013 an 8-point increase from November, an Ipsos Mori survey found.Emma Kavanagh, a psychologist and author, said she had noticed more people reaching out over social media. \u201cWe are tired and have been doing this for a long time and we had this initial array of coping capacity and it\u2019s simply burnt out. When you look at burnout by definition you\u2019re talking about being too stressed for too long. There is this experience where your brain reaches capacity and goes: \u2018I cannot give the same mental attention to this any more.\u201dKavanagh has been researching extreme environments in psychology, and said: \u201cSo what you find in these extreme environments, which is a nice analogy for where we are now in terms of unpredictability and uncontrollability \u2026 is that they find something called psychological hibernation which is the same as burnout.\u201cYou see things like your concentration getting sluggish, you find it harder to pay attention and you have sleep and memory issues.\u201dBut Kavanagh said people could come out of the current situation stronger. \u201cPeople who have survived disasters have no control over it but most will exhibit post-traumatic growth, a small minority will experience long-term health effects. The vast majority will return to a baseline of function or exhibit growth.\u201dSteven Taylor, a professor and clinical psychologist at the University of British Columbia, said at the start people had little to no knowledge of what a pandemic was and then as restrictions eased there was a sense that it was almost over.\u201cThen the second wave occurred and people in many countries were back in lockdown. In technical terms, people were in a situation of \u2018frustrative non-reward\u2019. They thought they would be rewarded with an end to the pandemic, but that reward was taken away from them. Understandably, people were frustrated,\u201d he said.\u201cMore generally, the stressfulness of a pandemic is related to how long it lasts. People are exposed to chronic stressors as pandemics drag out over many months and multiple lockdowns. That wears people down.\u201dHe said pandemic-related burnout was something people might experience where they feel \u201cincreasingly emotionally exhausted, despairing and irritable as the pandemic drags out\u201d. He compared this to what the World Health Organization has called \u201cpandemic fatigue\u201d.\u201cPandemic-related lockdowns and other restrictions disrupt our routines so that we no longer have fixed schedules or landmarks during our day \u2026 It can get to a point where every day is exactly the same. If there are no landmarks and little in the way of a fixed schedule, life becomes a blur, and people experience difficulty recalling what they did,\u201d he said.Julia Faulconbridge, the vice-chair of the division of clinical psychology at the British Psychological Society, said not everyone had the same experiences. She added that from a psychological point of view, the messaging that people had received had been hard to accept. \u201cIf you look back at early autumn things were getting worse but it was not so obvious for people. There was talk of what you would do for Christmas and vaccines coming.\u201d\u201cThen suddenly it was like all of that got swept away \u2026 suddenly the vaccine started to look more shaky as we heard about mutated strains and then, of course, we moved into this really serious crisis of health that has come since January.\u201dShe said many people would by now know someone who was ill or had died.\u201cThe whole thing becomes a lot darker in terms of what we think we are living through,\u201d she said. \u201cI would not use the term burnout but if you have pressures and stresses and difficulties going on in your life, those are almost certainly going to be exacerbated by being in lockdown.\u201cAny sort of pinch point or difficulty and stresses get exacerbated, and the longer they go on the more the pressure can build up and we are often isolated now from our normal support structures. For me, it\u2019s more than burnout, but people getting more and more trapped in difficulties \u2026 Every single person in this country is under stress to some extent or other in this pandemic.\u201cStress affects our bodies in ways that are described as burnout. That long-term stress is different from short-term and has an insidious and profound effect on how we can function. Even if we are functioning fairly well, we are not functioning as we used to.\u201d",

    "articles": "It was a sight as common as birds chirping in trees or cars idling in traffic. Nobody would do a double-take when they saw children playing with their grandparents. That was before the pandemic, when it was simply a routine image of daily life and not a potentially fatal activity.But more and more, in playgrounds across Jerusalem, a grandparent can be seen strolling along while a grandchild rushes ahead to slides and climbing frames.In this city, most older people are vaccinated against Covid-19 and are slowly emerging from nearly a year of strict isolation. While still not advised by authorities, some are cautiously returning to the thing they missed the most.\u201cThe feeling is extraordinary,\u201d said Yoel Silver, a 67-year-old lawyer, as he pushed his granddaughter on a swing. Twelve days before, Silver had received his second shot of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which initial data suggests gives a high level of resistance to the disease. For months he had mostly seen his 11 grandchildren on video calls.In a different park near the Old City of Jerusalem, another Israeli grandparent, Reuven Brauner, 70, said he and his wife had not socialised with friends but decided to visit their grandchildren after being immunised.\u201cOur understanding is that we are in a much safer position. Not 100%, but we feel sufficiently confident in the vaccine. We decided to go out and see the family,\u201d said Brauner, who wore a surgical mask over his grey beard as a precaution.His granddaughter, aged two, toddled around while her one-year-old brother lay in a pram nearby. Not being close to the younger grandchildren over the months had been especially hard, said Brauner. \u201cThey grow up so quickly at this age.\u201dIsrael is vaccinating its 9 million citizens at a higher rate than anywhere else. Close to 80% of people over 50 have received inoculations, and as of Thursday all people over 16 are eligible to receive a jab.The vaccination campaign has been the subject of intense global focus. Not only does it provide a test case for how the jabs work in the real world but it also exemplifies a highly unequal international vaccination push in which citizens of richer, more powerful nations will be first to see the benefits.While one in three Israelis has received a jab, Palestinians in the Israeli-controlled occupied territories are far behind. They are just now receiving the first batches of limited doses.Although Israel is leading the world in vaccinations, concerns remain around how much caution can be abandoned. The country is still under a lockdown, with relatively high daily infection figures.A health ministry official has advised grandparents to keep masks on and remain socially distanced from their grandchildren, warning the disease may still be transmitted by vaccinated people and keep the national infection rate high.Orli Shuruki, a 71-year-old from Jerusalem, has nine grandchildren and says she decided to get vaccinated because of them. \u201cI felt I had enough. I couldn\u2019t host my family. I could only see them through the window,\u201d she said.Her middle-aged children have also been given shots, and they decided to get together for a Saturday lunch last week for the first time in months.\u201cThe grandchildren couldn\u2019t remember when was the last time we gathered at home,\u201d she said. \u201cI think I had become depressed, and that is why I gained weight.\u201dShuruki said the family wore masks but took them off to eat, and split the tables to keep the households apart. Still, she allowed herself a brief embrace with her grandchildren.It was what the kids missed more than anything else, she said. \u201cThe hugs, only the hugs. They didn\u2019t care about what I cooked for them, only the hugs.\u201d",

    "articles": "The UK\u2019s physical isolation sets it apart from its continental neighbours, but could its island status have protected it from the full horror of Covid-19, had it closed borders in early 2020, as New Zealand and Taiwan did?Both have been applauded for their efficient handling of the pandemic, with just 33 Covid-19 deaths between them. Other island nations such as Tonga, in the South Pacific Ocean, have reported no infections.\u201cTo be an island in 2020 or 2021 is probably the greatest geographical gift you could have,\u201d said Prof Devi Sridhar, chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh.So, as British cases start to fall and discussions about easing lockdown restrictions resume, are there strategies it could borrow to return it to normality?From the UK\u2019s shores, New Zealand\u2019s current situation looks idyllic: \u201cAfter the lockdown(s), which were only required because border closure came too late, day-to-day life for most New Zealanders appears to be completely normal, and there are very few restrictions\u201d said Matt Boyd at Adapt Research Ltd in Reefton, New Zealand, who has modelled the impacts of border closures for island nations.Even his own pre-Covid predictions about a major loss of tourism revenues if New Zealand ever closed its borders, have not entirely come to pass. Tourist operators continue to call for emergency funding, but the economic impact has been blunted by New Zealanders holidaying domestically, Boyd said: \u201cSocially there have been family separations, people unable to return home for funerals, or see dying loved ones. But the social, economic and political consequences in New Zealand seem less than in countries dealing with ongoing community transmission.\u201dThis begs the question: would the UK now be in a similar position, had it acted earlier? The UK confirmed its first Covid-19 case on 31 January \u2013 three weeks before the virus arrived in New Zealand. \u201cLogistically it would have meant making a decision very early on,\u201d said Boyd.Yet speed is of the essence, and other countries managed it: \u201cTaiwan and Hong Kong imposed the first measures as early as 31 December. South Korea, Thailand and Japan also responded quickly,\u201d said Kelley Lee, professor of global health governance at Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, Canada, whose team recently reviewed 29 studies modelling the impact of travel restrictions on Covid-19 transmission. \u201cWe found that if cross-border measures are going to work, they need to be applied early on.\u201dThe British home secretary, Priti Patel, recently said she had advocated shutting the UK\u2019s borders in March. But although a series of travel measures were introduced in 2020 \u2013 including issuing non-mandatory guidance to self-isolate for 14 days to travellers coming from designated high-risk countries \u2013 this was withdrawn on 13 March, with no further border measures in place until 8 June.Genetic analysis revealed that Sars-CoV-2 was individually introduced well over a thousand times during early 2020 \u2013 mostly from Spain, France, and Italy. \u201cLate February to mid March were critical,\u201d said Prof Oliver Pybus at the University of Oxford, who led this research. \u201cDuring this period, high numbers of incoming travellers from Europe coincided with large and growing epidemics in many European countries.\u201dThe result was multiple chains of transmission being initiated in parallel at different locations. This rapidly overwhelmed the UK\u2019s existing capacity for individual-level contact tracing. It also prevented the virus from being contained in a particular part of the country through a cordon sanitaire like in Wuhan, China. \u201cIt\u2019s likely that the importations resulted in the early phase of epidemic growth accelerating faster than was expected,\u201d said Pybus. \u201cImportations mean the virus can reach less well-connected or more remote parts of the country more quickly.\u201dThe UK\u2019s connectedness may also have put it at a disadvantage. \u201cLike France and Germany, we\u2019re kind of in that position of connecting Asia and the Americas and Africa as a pretty central point in the world, so we have a lot of people connecting through but also coming here,\u201d said Andrew Tatem, professor of spatial demography and epidemiology at the University of Southampton. \u201cThat is something that governments always have to balance up, because a lot of our service industries are based on that connectivity.\u201dEven though rapid action can buy a country time, it does not completely prevent virus from being imported \u2013 as further small outbreaks in New Zealand have shown. \u201cGovernments need to use that time to put in place and fortify domestic public health measures \u2013 notably testing and quarantine,\u201d said Lee. \u201cIt is what governments do domestically in addition to cross-border measures that has contributed to how they\u2019ve fared over the past year.\u201dIt may not be too late. Many British scientists would like to see the UK further tighten its borders and pursue a \u201czero-Covid\u201d strategy in the coming months. \u201cPeople talk about living with the virus. But what is that?\u201d said Martin McKee, a professor of European Public Health at the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine.Either we try to eliminate the virus, meaning minimising travel and maintaining lockdown restrictions until there are so few cases they can be managed through contact tracing \u2013 as New Zealand has done \u2013 or ease restrictions earlier, in the hope that the vaccine will provide a solution, McKee said. It will still be many months before everyone is vaccinated, and new variants may be imported from abroad. The UK government is not convinced about the need for blanket border restrictions. It is also scrambling to book tens of thousands of hotel rooms to quarantine arrivals from 33 high-risk countries on the UK travel ban list, which are due to open on 15 February.Speaking at the Commons transport select committee on Wednesday, the transport secretary, Grant Shapps, said: \u201cWe are an island nation unlike \u2026 Australia or something which is an entire continent \u2013 and that means that we need to get medicines in, we need to get food in, we need to get our raw materials in, sometimes we have to move people around, scientists and others.It\u2019s true the UK is more connected than Australia or New Zealand. But Taiwan is heavily interconnected in terms of trade, and its food self-sufficiency rate is 32%, making it heavily reliant on food imports. For the UK it is about 64%.However, it is a misnomer to use the term \u201cborder closure\u201d to describe what other island nations have done. \u201cFew countries, if any, have completely closed their borders during this pandemic,\u201d said Lee. \u201cAustralia and New Zealand continue to have travellers and trade flowing into their countries. But they have reduced these to essential traffic, and they have then also introduced screening, testing and quarantine measures that ensure that anyone and anything entering their countries are virus-free.\u201cThe task, therefore, is to decide what is essential versus non-essential traffic. It is essential that food supplies, medicines and key workers, for example, continue to flow across borders. However non-essential travel should be discouraged.\u201dThe UK now faces a similar dilemma: \u201cWe have a choice here between opening up in the UK or being able to travel abroad,\u201d said Sridhar. \u201cWould you like to be able to socialise, have children at school, go to bars, watch live sports events, attend music events and get back to daily life, but at the expense of not being able to travel? Or would you like to go abroad and cross borders but live with tighter restrictions for the foreseeable future?.\u201dAsk a New Zealander which they would choose.",

    "articles": "Belgium has allowed hairdressers to reopen the weekend after next in a slight easing of Covid restrictions as serious infections slow, Reuters reports.The Belgian government, regional chiefs and health experts decided after a three-hour meeting today to permit camping and cabin sites to reopen from Monday, hairdressers and zoos from 13 February and beauty parlours from 1 March.Prime minister Alexander De Croo said the measures should not be understood as the start of wide-scale easing. The consultation committee is very aware of the fact that personal care plays an important role in how we feel and how we feel is a very important element in helping us through the very difficult months to come,\u201d he told a news conference. We have to be particularly careful with the situation. That is why the consultation committee has chosen a very cautious approach.Belgium has recorded more than Covid-19 21,000 fatalities among its 11 million people, more than most other countries proportionally. However, while cases have been inching up with more children tested, daily hospital admissions and fatalities have been heading down. The health agency said Belgium had been in a clear plateau since November, unlike many other countries.The Belgian government says it needs to have fewer than 800 confirmed infections a day and 75 daily hospital admissions for a period of three weeks before substantially easing lockdown rules. Those figures are now respectively 2,349 and 121.The UK variant of coronavirus, more infectious than the previously dominant strain, has taken over as the main cause of new Covid cases in Slovakia, prime minister Igor Matovic has said.Matovic said the government had checked all positive samples of PCR laboratory tests taken in the country yesterday and preliminary results showed 71% were the UK variant.So far from 1,360 clinical samples positively tested by RT-PCR, 71% have been diagnosed as the B.1.1.7 UK variant of SARS-CoV-2.Reuters reports that hospitals in the central European country of 5.5 million has been strained with 3,560 coronavirus patients as of today. The British variant is believed to be up to 70% more infectious than the previously dominant strain, and may also be 30% more lethal, some scientists say.The proportion was even higher among coronavirus patients at the Louis Pasteur University Hospital in the eastern Slovak city of Kosice where tests showed 91% carried the UK variant of the virus, news agency TASR reported. Slovakia has recorded 5,050 deaths from the coronavirus.Matovic said the spread of the UK variant made it difficult to ease lockdown measures, as his ruling coalition was split today on whether to reopen lower grades of elementary schools and kindergartens as planned next week.Such a proportion of the Brit (mutation) means that any easing without any adequate protective/compensatory measures will cause an increase of positive cases and an erosion of the situation.The Biden administration has said it is invoking the Defense Production Act to help Pfizer ramp up vaccine production and that \u201cevery option\u201d was on the table to produce more Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine should it be authorised, Reuters reports.It will also use the wartime powers to increase at-home Covid-19 tests, and make more surgical gloves in the US, officials said at a media briefing today.The White House also said it would deploy 1,100 troops to help get Americans get the jabs at state vaccination centres after a request for assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, AP reports.President Joe Biden has called for setting up 100 mass vaccination centrrs around the country within a month. Two are opening in California, and Coronavirus senior adviser Andy Slavitt said military personnel would arrive at those centres in a little over a week.Currently about 6.9 million Americans have received the full two-dose regimen required to get maximum protection from the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines. That translates to about 2% of the US population.World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has called on companies to share manufacturing facilities to help ramp up the production of Covid-19 vaccines, Reuters reports.Speaking at an online news briefing from Geneva, Adhanom Ghebreyesus said almost 130 countries with a combined population of 2.5 billion people were yet to administer a single dose of vaccine, and repeated his plea for rich nations to share doses with poorer countries once they have vaccinated health workers and older people.\u201cBut we also need a massive scale-up in production,\u201d the WHO director general said. \u201cLast week, Sanofi announced it would make its manufacturing infrastructure available to support production of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. We call on other companies to follow this example.\u201dFrench drug maker Sanofi said last week it would will fill and pack millions of doses of Pfizer\u2019s vaccine from July, aiming to help supply more than 100 million doses this year from its German plant to meet massive demand.A more contagious variant of the coronavirus first detected in Britain now accounts for almost 6% of all cases in Germany, officials said Friday.The head of Germany\u2019s disease control agency said labs examined the genome of the virus in more than 30,000 positive samples last week to assess the spread of the variant, known to scientists as B.1.1.7., and two others that were first found in South Africa and Brazil.\u201cThe three variants, particularly B.1.1.7., have arrived in Germany,\u201d Lothar Wieler, president of the Robert Koch Institute, told reporters in Berlin.\u201cThey\u2019re not dominant yet, but we have to reckon that their share will continue to rise, just as it has been reported from other European countries in recent weeks.\u201dGerman Chancellor Angela Merkel said Thursday that the prevalence of new variants of the virus will play a role in discussions between the federal and state governments next week about whether to extend existing lockdown restrictions beyond mid-February.Wieler said the variant first observed in Britain and now detected in 13 of Germany\u2019s 16 states \u201cis more contagious than the existing one, and there are first indications that it can also lead to more serious illnesses.\u201dThe US House of Representatives was expected to approve a budget measure on Friday that would enable Democrats to push President Joe Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief package through Congress without Republican support in a process that will likely take weeks. The senate narrowly approved a version of the budget plan at the end of a marathon debate that went into Friday morning. House leaders said lawmakers will begin a procedural vote around midday, and if that succeeds, the budget will be deemed adopted. Democrats and the Biden administration have said they want comprehensive legislation to move quickly to address a pandemic that has killed more than 450,000 Americans and left millions jobless. Italy reported 377 coronavirus-related deaths on Friday against 421 the day before, the health ministry said, while the daily tally of new infections rose to 14,218 from 13,659 the day before. Some 270,507 tests for Covid-19 were carried out in the past day, virtually stable compared with a previous 270,142, the health ministry said. Italy has registered 90,618 deaths linked to COVID-19 since its outbreak emerged last February, the second-highest toll in Europe after Britain and the sixth-highest in the world. The country has reported 2.61 million cases to date. Patients in the hospital with Covid-19 - not including those in intensive care - stood at 19,575 on Friday, down from 19,743 a day earlier.Britain\u2019s Oxford University said on Friday its researchers behind the joint AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine had found it to be effective against the UK virus variant now dominant across the country.The university, which developed the jab with the British-Swedish pharmaceutical firm, said an ongoing assessment of its effectiveness showed that it has \u201csimilar efficacy\u201d to other coronavirus strains. \u201cData from our trials... in the United Kingdom indicate that the vaccine not only protects against the original pandemic virus but also protects against the novel variant,\u201d said Andrew Pollard, a co-chief investigator on the Oxford vaccine trial.The analysis, which relied on samples taken between October and mid-January, also indicated the jab reduces \u201cduration of shedding and viral load\u201d, which may translate into reduced virus transmission, the university said.President Joe Biden said on Friday that fresh data on the health of the US jobs market shows the need for aggressive action by Congress on a coronavirus relief bill. Meeting with top Democrats from the US House of Representatives at the White House, Biden said the US would not return to full employment at the current jobs-creation pace for 10 years, underscoring the need for lawmakers to act.European nations need to work more closely with drug firms to increase the pace of coronavirus inoculations, the World Health Organization said, as Johnson &amp; Johnson pushed for its jab to become the third approved for use in the US.EU chiefs have engaged in bitter public rows with firms over supply shortages and legal obligations, as a slow vaccine rollout has sparked public anger and plunged the bloc\u2019s leadership into crisis.\u201cWe need to join up to speed up vaccinations,\u201d the World Health Organization\u2019s Europe director, Hans Kluge, told AFP in an interview.\u201cOtherwise, competing pharmaceutical companies (must) join efforts to drastically increase production capacity \u2026 that\u2019s what we need,\u201d he added.In a sign of Europe\u2019s increasing urgency, top EU diplomat Josep Borrell said he hoped Russia\u2019s Sputnik V jab would be approved for use in Europe soon.\u201cIt\u2019s good news for the whole of mankind because it means we will have more tools to fight the pandemic,\u201d he said during a visit to Moscow.Experts have warned that vaccines will only control the contagion \u2013 which has killed more than 2 million people since emerging in late 2019 \u2013 if the whole world is covered.Although more than 115m shots have so far been administered, most have been in high-income countries.Kluge reiterated the WHO\u2019s call for rich countries to help poorer parts of the world, urging them to donate spare doses after inoculating the most vulnerable parts of their populations.",

    "articles": "The US Senate has passed a budget resolution that allows for the passage of Joe Biden\u2019s $1.9tn (\u00a31.4tn) Covid-19 relief package in the coming weeks without Republican support.The vice-president, Kamala Harris, broke a 50/50 tie by casting a vote in favour of the Democratic measure, which sends it to the House of Representatives for final approval. It marked the first time Harris, in her role as president of the Senate, cast a tie-breaking vote after being sworn in as the first female vice-president on 20 January.The House passed its own budget measure on Wednesday. Congress can now work to write a bill that can be passed by a simple majority in both houses, which are controlled by Democrats. Mid-March has been suggested as a likely date by which the measure could be passed, a point at which enhanced unemployment benefits will expire if Congress does not act.The vote came at 5.30am on Friday at the end of a marathon Senate debate session, known among senators as a \u201cvote-a-rama\u201d, a procedure whereby they can theoretically offer unlimited amendments. Biden is scheduled to meet with Democratic House leaders and committee chairs early on Friday morning to discuss the Covid economic stimulus, and is expected to make public remarks on the progress at an 11.45am EST (1645 GMT) briefing.There was dissent from Republicans in the Senate overnight, particularly over plans for a $15 federal minimum wage. Iowa\u2019s Republican senator, Joni Ernst, raised an amendment to \u201cprohibit the increase of the federal minimum wage during a global pandemic\u201d, which was carried by a voice vote.The Vermont senator Bernie Sanders said he still intended to support bringing the measure through: \u201cWe need to end the crisis of starvation wages in Iowa and around the United States.\u201dHe outlined plans to get a wage increase, phased in over five years, included in a budget reconciliation bill. The federal minimum wage is currently $7.25 an hour, and has not been raised since 2009.In a tweet after the vote, Sanders said: \u201cToday, with the passage of this budget resolution to provide relief to our working families, we have the opportunity not only to address the pandemic and the economic collapse \u2013 we have the opportunity to give hope to the American people and restore faith in our government.\u201dDuring the debate Senate minority leader Mitch McConnell said \u201cThis is not the time for trillions more dollars to make perpetual lockdowns and economic decline a little more palatable. Notwithstanding the actual needs, notwithstanding all the talk about bipartisan unity, Democrats in Congress are plowing ahead. They\u2019re using this phony budget to set the table to ram through their $1.9 trillion rough draft.\u201dThe $1.9 trillion relief package proposed would be used to speed Covid-19 vaccines throughout the nation. Other funds would extend special unemployment benefits that will expire at the end of March and make direct payments to people to help them pay bills and stimulate the economy. Democrats also want to send money to state and local governments dealing with the worst health crisis in decades.",

Bounce, a little bit of reverse, really good Indian attack, so it\u2019s important that we make the best of it tomorrow.\u201d That may depend on Ben Stokes and Ollie Pope, and whether they can stay in while scraping off the rust. Root is the third Englishman ever to make a hundred in his hundredth Test, joining Colin Cowdrey and Alec Stewart. Cowdrey did it at the age of 35, Stewart at 37. Root has only just turned 30. He is playing some lovely tunes and has entered what Smash Hits magazine would have called \u201chis imperial phase\u201d. It will be fascinating to see if he can keep it up. Thanks for your company, sorry not to get through all the emails, and we\u2019ll see you tomorrow for the next episode of The Root Show.After all that, you\u2019re probably expecting a match report. And here it is. Warning: it contains the words \u201cwonderful\u201d and \u201cmasterful\u201d in the same sentence. And fair enough: Root, on this tour, is making his way through the thesaurus.The day has belonged to Joe Root, and to Channel 4, who will surely have racked up some handy ratings. And there\u2019s a lot more to come on the telly, as Paul MacInnes reports. And that is that. So the day ends on a sorrowful note for England, but let\u2019s not allow it to take anything away from Joe Root, who has been superhuman on this tour. When he made 228 and 186 in Sri Lanka, it was ravenous batting against a middling attack. Today, he found another level to go up to by adding 128, unbeaten, in his hundredth Test, against Bumrah, Ashwin and Ishant. After spending the whole week talking the talk, he has walked the walk. And on terrestrial TV too. As Alastair Cook says on Channel 4, it\u2019s been \u201can absolutely brilliant innings\u201d.Yes, slamming into leg stump. A great delivery, and a sad moment for Sibley, but he did so well. He gave his all, faced 286 balls, and played his part in a partnership of exactly 200.A superb yorker! This looks out, and is given, but they\u2019re reviewing \u2013 might as well...89th over: England 263-2 (Sibley 87, Root 128) A single to each batsman off Ashwin, and that\u2019s the 200 partnership off 62.4 overs. It\u2019s been slow, then quick, then measured. And magnificent. 88th over: England 261-2 (Sibley 86, Root 127) Bumrah was just changing ends. He gets some lovely lift outside off, but Sibley was never planning to play a shot. He just wants to bat through the day: that hundred can wait.87th over: England 261-2 (Sibley 86, Root 127) Bumrah, despite beating Root twice in two balls, is taken off, to make way for Ashwin. He gets a moral victory too, luring Root into a thick outside edge, but it just trickles away for a single. These two batsmen have now quadrupled the score. And Root celebrates with a six! A slog-sweep, crisply done, although the effort lands him on the deck with another bout of cramp. Stuart Broad trots out with some kind of energy drink, and no doubt berates his captain for leaving him out on a pitch that\u2019s giving the seamers some help. 86th over: England 251-2 (Sibley 85, Root 118) Root, facing Ishant, is still up to playing his favourite shot, the unforced force into the covers, though it only brings a single this time.\u201cAside Root\u2019s serene majesty,\u201d says Guy Hornsby, \u201cwe should also delight in Sibley\u2019s obduracy here too. He had an absolute mare in Galle and rode his luck last dip but he\u2019s been chanceless here, and has really moved well and been rock solid. It\u2019s vital, given how big we\u2019ll need to go here.\u201d Rock-solid, that\u2019s his game.85th over: England 250-2 (Sibley 85, Root 117) Root has cramp, understandably \u2013 he has said that he used to cramp up on getting to 80 in Asian Tests, so this is progress. He plays a pull at Bumrah, gets a thick bottom edge and jogs a single to bring up the 250. Five overs to get through before he has a well-earned bath.84th over: England 249-2 (Sibley 85, Root 116) Sharma to Sibley, which means quite a lot of shouldering arms. There was a danger today that thousands of kids would taste Test cricket for the first time and find that the main ingredient was Sibley leaving the ball. Root\u2019s hundred has made sure there\u2019s something to get excited about instead. And there\u2019s time, just, for Sibley to join him, although he\u2019s probably not remotely fussed. 83rd over: England 249-2 (Sibley 85, Root 116) Back comes Bumrah, and Root, light on his feet, goes deep in the crease to deflect for two. Bumrah finds his radar, gets one to hold its line outside off and beats Root, which is no mean feat at the moment. And then he does it again, with a carbon copy. He could easily have four for 39 by now, rather than just the one.82nd over: England 247-2 (Sibley 85, Root 114) Now Kohli does take the new ball, so perhaps he agrees that it was crazy not to. He hands it to Ishant, who immediately finds some tasty outswing, adding to the feeling that Jimmy Anderson could have some fun here. Root ignores that first outswinger but creams the next one through the covers. Old ball, new ball, seeing it like a football. There\u2019s only one slip and a gully, so even if he does nick it, he may well get away with it.81st over: England 242-2 (Sibley 85, Root 109) So the new ball is due \u2013 and Kohli doesn\u2019t take it. This is either madness or genius. Ashwin, to be fair, finds some lavish turn, though the ball merely misses Sibley\u2019s inside edge and goes for four leg byes. There have been 57 runs off the last ten overs. John Jervis (55th over), your dream is in danger of coming true. 80th over: England 235-2 (Sibley 83, Root 108) Channel 4 are showing the highlights of a memorable innings, but Root is busy adding another one \u2013 an off-drive off the off-spinner, Sundar, which, as Mark Butcher says, anyone else would have played to mid-on with the spin. Root has 37 off his last 31 deliveries, and that\u2019s been against a soft old ball. The new one could go either way. \u201cEngland captain @root66 healthily distracting kids from homeschooling everywhere in the UK,\u201d says Alison Mitchell on Twitter. \u201cin his 100th Test, and in India to boot. It\u2019s an education of its own.\u201d79th over: England 228-2 (Sibley 83, Root 101) Kohli brings back Ashwin, presumably for one over before the new ball. It almost works as Sibley goes down the track and gets in a tangle, but the appeal is stifled.In case you\u2019ve just joined us, here are Root\u2019s scores in the first innings of his three Tests this year: 228, 186, 101 not out. All in Asia, all in the heat, all as captain. Stunning stuff.78th over: England 227-2 (Sibley 83, Root 100) Root drives Sundar down the ground \u2013 but there\u2019s a fine diving stop and he only gets one, to go to 99. The good piece of fielding is followed by a bad one as Sibley sweeps and Gill lets it through his hands, and legs: a double nutmeg. Sibley calmly gives the strike back to Root, who flicks to leg to reach a hundred in his hundredth Test \u2013 and his third in three Tests this year. He takes his helmet off, gives Sibley an illicit hug, and smiles that boyish smile of his, as well he may. Say what you like about lockdown, it has landed England\u2019s best batsman in the form of his life.77th over: England 218-2 (Sibley 76, Root 98) There\u2019s a little corner of Sibley\u2019s psyche that doesn\u2019t entirely fancy this sidekick role. He cuts Shahbaz for four, then tries again, but finds the man at extra-cover. He has 12 off the last ten overs, to Root\u2019s 34.76th over: England 214-2 (Sibley 72, Root 98) Sibley, not to be totally outshone, sweeps Sundar for four, meeting the ball almost as crisply as Root. Then he misses another sweep, prompting an appeal and a brief conference, but they don\u2019t review because the ball pitched outside leg because Sundar is coming round the wicket. Reviewing is one of two things India have done conspicuously well today, along with keeping up the over-rate.75th over: England 209-2 (Sibley 67, Root 98) Root plays a late cut off Shahbaz \u2013 so late that it could almost be a UK government response to the coronavirus. Except that it\u2019s beautiful.74th over: England 205-2 (Sibley 67, Root 94) Sibley brings up the 200 with a flick off Sundar, but he\u2019s just the sidekick now. The star turn is Root, who threads it through the on side for four more, to go into the nineties. And that\u2019s drinks, with Root in full flow and England (whisper it) on top. That said, the new ball is half an hour away, and it will only take a couple of nicks to even things up. Here\u2019s Mike Jakeman, picking up on 9:01. \u201cThe madness in Madras Simon Wilde referred to also saw Kiran Nair make 303*,\u201d he notes. \u201cHas any Test triple-centurion gone on to play fewer matches than his six?\u201d The answer, it seems, is no. But Nair is young enough to come again.73rd over: England 199-2 (Sibley 66, Root 89) Root switches his hands round and plays a superb reverse sweep for four. Shahbaz responds by going over the wicket and bowling into the rough. It\u2019s the first day of the series and Root has already turned Kohli into Nasser Hussain in 2002, desperately ordering Ashley Giles to wheel away outside leg to keep Sachin Tendulkar quiet.72nd over: England 188-2 (Sibley 65, Root 80) A few singles off Washington Sundar, whose bowling has not been half as impressive as his name. He and Shahbaz, on this evidence, are much the same as Jack Leach and Dom Bess, and some way behind Ravi Ashwin. But it is only the first day of the match.71st over: England 185-2 (Sibley 64, Root 78) Root plays his tenth sweep, off Shahbaz, and miscues for the first time, but gets away with it as his top edge comes down in no-man\u2019s-land at deep midwicket. Irritated with himself, he nails the next sweep, picks up four in the same direction, and passes 500 runs in Tests this winter. His scores have been 228, 1, 186, 11 and 78 not out: an extraordinary Joe, flowing like The Don. 70th over: England 178-2 (Sibley 64, Root 71) Root puts on his dancing shoes and meets a ball from Sundar on the half-volley, but only gets a single. A caption tells us that he\u2019s played the sweep shot nine times, connecting with every one, and making 16 runs. 69th over: England 177-2 (Sibley 64, Root 70) For his other young spinner, Shahbaz, Kohli tries a pair of silly mid-offs, standing next to each other like kids in the Under-9s. In an ideal world, one of them would be making a daisy chain.68th over: England 177-2 (Sibley 64, Root 70) England have now seen off Bumrah too. Kohli brings back Washington Sundar, and Root sweeps his first ball for four to overtake Sibley. The gauntlet has been thrown down. Sundar has a leg slip and a silly square leg as Butcher calls it, but they\u2019re not going to stop the sweep, which Root plays again, for two more.67th over: England 171-2 (Sibley 64, Root 64) Root sweeps Shahbaz to draw level again. Sure enough, Sibley darts out of his crease, but succeeds only in turning a length ball into a yorker, which he digs out. \u201cDom Sibley and Joe Root were both teenage prodigies,\u201d says Gary Naylor on Twitter, \u201cbut the transition to full potential has been different \u2013 and we can see it right here, right now. A crisis for Sibley threatened his career; a crisis for Root threatened his conversion rate. It takes all kinds.\u201d A semi-colon and a quote from Fatboy Slim, all in one tweet. 66th over: England 170-2 (Sibley 64, Root 63) Bumrah tries the yorker again, but Root is equal to it. It\u2019s followed by a bouncer, and he copes with that too, playing a careful pull for two, though there\u2019s an inside edge a minute later. Mark Butcher is on commentary, trying to explain the World Test Championship scenario, messing it up, and doing it with such good humour that you don\u2019t mind at all. He\u2019s one of the best TV commentators in England, third only to Mike Atherton and Nasser Hussain.65th over: England 167-2 (Sibley 64, Root 60) Great psychology from Root, drawing level with Sibley, who wants to keep his nose in front. He goes down the track to Shahbaz not once, not twice, but three times, and the middle one brings an on-drive for four.\u201cThird time Sibley has faced more than 200 balls,\u201d says Rory Dollard on Twitter. \u201cBoth previous times he\u2019s gone past 300, made a ton and England won the game.\u201d64th over: England 163-2 (Sibley 60, Root 60) England have again seen off Ishant, who has bowled really well with nothing to show for it but economy (12-2-21-0). Back comes Bumrah, his run ever shorter, his arm ever stiffer, and Root pushes into the covers for four to bring up the hundred partnership. It\u2019s taken 234 balls, and it was just what England needed after losing two wickets for none just before lunch.63rd over: England 159-2 (Sibley 60, Root 56) Better from Shahbaz Nadeem, who manages a maiden. Sibley has now faced 206 balls \u2013 a double Dentury. Joe Denly, eh, those were the days.\u201cNow #seashanties are back in again,\u201d says Miranda Jollie, \u201cI am singing Spanish Ladies along to the cricket. \u2018From Ishant to Sibley \u2019tis 35 leagues\u2019.\u201d Ha. And one of those leagues is the IPL, which you won\u2019t find Sibley in any time soon.62nd over: England 159-2 (Sibley 60, Root 56) Ishant finds some reverse swing, jagging it back into Root, who adjusts and tucks a single. These conditions \u2013 a slow pitch, but enough movement off the seam and in the air even when the ball is in shreds \u2013 are just made for senior seamers. If only England had two of them.",

    "articles": "When the request went out for a \u201cbespectacled guinea pig\u201d to test if anti-fog treatments actually work when you wear a face mask, I was desperate.As someone with such a strong genetic predisposition for eyesight issues that I practically came out of the womb wearing glasses, lens fogging has long been a frustration. Even when I\u2019m not wearing a mask, my glasses will fog up after something as innocent as a run for the bus.Now that mask use is the norm, glasses fogging has become an unavoidable part of daily life. And it\u2019s absolutely maddening.As a journalist, the rising fog has become particularly stressful at press conferences.Having repeatedly asked New South Wales premier Gladys Berejiklian what she believed the benefits were of holding off making masks mandatory in late December, I was cursing myself in the coming days when, after she urged everyone to wear one as a precaution, I found myself unable to see her standing two metres in front of me.Recently, I\u2019ve resorted to wearing a face shield on late-night trips to the supermarket, mocked by friends who\u2019ve caught me in the act. I thought there had to be a better way.It turns out, there is.I was able to pick up a pack of Clearwipe Antifog Lens Cleaners from Chemist Warehouse for $4.49, and they\u2019re widely available elsewhere too. The box contains 20 single-use microfibre wipes \u2013 in little sachets, similar to hand cleaners from fast-food restaurants.These also clean your lenses, and unlike the spray and gel, are only designed for eyeglasses.These wipes are easy to apply and the glasses dry quickly, but while they made my lenses look nice and clear, as you\u2019d expect from a cleaning product, the anti-fog results were underwhelming.To test if these wipes work, I wore a disposable mask, with the wire bent snugly around my nose and the loops inverted around my ears (a tip I\u2019d heard reduces fogging).My glasses fogged after taking a few average breaths and speaking some random words to mimic conversation.The verdict: There was slightly less fog compared with untreated glasses, but not enough to stop me being driven insane after 30 seconds.Dr Film\u2019s Premium Anti-Fog Spray ($29.95) applies just how you\u2019d imagine a spray would. After coating both the front and back of each lens to give it the best chance at success, I let the liquid dry without rinsing, as per the instructions.Once it dries, there is a very fine but noticeable film over the lenses, which makes the glasses slightly translucent \u2013 the sort of state that would ordinarily prompt you to clean them.Using a different pair of glasses, but the same disposable mask \u2013 with nose wire and inverted ear straps \u2013 I took some test breaths and spoke.My glasses still fogged up, but it wasn\u2019t as intense as with bare lenses. While the fogging seemed limited to the edges of the lens frames, it was still very noticeable.The verdict: This spray is also designed to be used on sports goggles and snorkelling masks. So it\u2019s possible that while it can deal with the heat and associated steam that come off eyeballs, it can\u2019t cope with hot breath.Pro Gear\u2019s Anti-Fog Cleaning Gel ($19.95) is fiddly. It comes in a tiny (5g) tube, which needs to be unscrewed \u2013 no easy task. From there you need to cut the tip of the tube\u2019s spout with scissors.Using a third pair of glasses, I applied a very small dot, about the size of a sesame seed, on to both the front and back of each lens, and rubbed it in with the cloth provided until the lenses were dry.I put the glasses on and wore the same test mask as previously.I took a deep breath in, and exhaled. No fog. I then exclaimed \u201cWow, no fog!\u201d \u2013 an utterance which produced no fog.I then tried with a reusable face mask (mine was from Uniqlo) which I\u2019d bought months ago, and wore once before realising it didn\u2019t have a nose-fitting wire and fogged my glasses. Even with this mask, I was able to breath and talk without fogging my glasses at all.I brought the glasses to my mouth and hushed heavily on them \u2013 in the way you do before wiping them generally. No fog.So excited by the clear lenses in front of me, I ran to turn on my kettle and stuck my face directly over the rising steam.No fog. However doing this seemed to push the limits of the gel\u2019s technology, as a slight water residue formed along parts of the lenses. This didn\u2019t fog up the lenses, but it made my glasses a tad blurry until the water dried about 30 seconds later.The verdict: It\u2019s hard to believe I went months before trying this gel, and given it\u2019s cheaper than the somewhat less effective spray, I\u2019ll be recommending it to every four-eyes I see in the street.",

There\u2019s something humanising about the appearance of pets during work video calls \u2013 and it can bring teams closer together in spite of the physical distance.\u201cNearly all of us have been in virtual meetings where kids or pets have popped up ... You connect more with the people behind the corporate roles when you know a bit more about their home life and families,\u201d says Katharine King, global research director at GVC Group, the gaming business.With the pandemic expected to continue well into next year, it\u2019s understandable for remote-work fatigue to set in. But focusing on the many upsides of working from home can help. The time and money saved by avoiding long commutes, and not having to maintain an expensive work wardrobe immediately come to mind.Other upsides stem from operational changes. Making time for a quick \u201cmini-meeting\u201d every morning to check in and chat has boosted morale for many scattered across the country. \u201cUnexpectedly it\u2019s brought our team closer,\u201d says Jill Kidson, head of consumer marketing at the children\u2019s publisher Walker Books.Using technology to chat throughout the day also has its benefits. First thing every morning, Katie Jansons, part of the IT operations team for the AA, opens her online chat and keeps it running all day so her team, which includes five people in Bangalore, can chime in whenever they need to share something. \u201cAll the niceties are now virtual. Maybe [this shift] has humanised us because we\u2019ve all needed that extra personal connection.\u201dOne unexpected benefit of remote work was having the time to really get to know a new starter on her team. \u201cIf we were in the office, I\u2019d be in meetings, but [at home] having video calls and constant conversations with them has been more rewarding.\u201dA Friday wrap-up call brings each week to a close for Jansons\u2019s eight-strong team \u2013 with the help of a music playlist. \u201cWe refer to it as #deskdisco,\u201d she says. In early summer, all the UK-based IT service portfolio managers shared a virtual cream tea, eaten at individual addresses across the country, in a bid to have a team experience after other planned awaydays had been cancelled.Then there are the bigger operational upsides. For some this simply means more people turning up for meetings, as dialling in from home affords fewer excuses not to show your face. When Deborah Mack, the new interim director of the Smithsonian National Museum of African Art, held her first meeting, it had to be via a video call. She had 100% attendance, a first for an all-staff meeting.For some firms, the pivot to remote work has proved the ideal opportunity to reboot how they run their businesses, including transforming their digital operations. This may mean adopting new digital processes and initiatives or even switching digital workflow platforms entirely.The AA is a client of ServiceNow, a leader in digital workflow solutions. As the AA\u2019s continuous improvement and tooling solutions manager, Jansons manages the IT service management solution for all IT interactions. Everyone who works for the AA, from frontline patrols to contact centre staff, has instant access to the AA\u2019s IT support department if they need technical assistance.During the pandemic, the need to keep things running despite staff being geographically distanced prompted the AA to roll out chatbot virtual agents, powered by ServiceNow. \u201cIndividual home broadband speed suddenly became part of our infrastructure in a way we hadn\u2019t envisioned before,\u201d says Jansons. \u201cIt became a high priority. We configured our virtual agent to be able to talk users through how to check home broadband, ensure it was plugged in correctly etc, and to [send] that information in a ticket to our IT support team.\u201dAnother big benefit came from rolling out ServiceNow\u2019s Agent Workspace for the AA\u2019s service desk, which reduced the amount of time it took to log details of an IT incident. \u201cA new dynamic user interface sped up our ticket handling, reducing the time it takes to raise an average [IT issue] by a minute. We saved the equivalent of approximately eight hours a week for the service desk team, which is about one working day,\u201d says Jansons. Her team has also launched the ServiceNow mobile app, which she says is like a virtual version of the AA\u2019s office-based tech hub, where staff could previously get IT assistance.At GVC Group, King has found that getting more out of technology has been a big unexpected benefit. \u201cNow everyone is comfortable doing things virtually, we can mix teams up and do activities like training and development or business updates with people who we don\u2019t usually work with in different offices or countries.\u201d Zero travel time means she can join in meetings with colleagues in other time zones, and persuade those geographically distant to adapt their working day. \u201c[Colleagues in the US] don\u2019t mind rolling out of bed and straight into meetings and then taking back the time at the other end of their day,\u201d she adds.Annie Auerbach, who wrote a book about the benefits of a more flexible approach to working life \u2013 Flex: Reinventing Work for a Smarter, Happier Life \u2013 agrees. \u201cWe are gaining freedom to listen to our circadian rhythms and mould our days accordingly. If you are a night owl, embrace the evenings and let the morning be slow. If you are a lark \u2013 and are waking even earlier with angst \u2013 work while the kids sleep.\u201dAuerbach adds that the benefits work both ways. \u201cThere are significant benefits to business, including accessing the best talent, who might have been excluded from macho working cultures of long hours and presenteeism.\u201dOther intangible upsides include the new kind of creativity that can be fostered by working from home \u2013 thanks, for instance, to the ability to think more obliquely while going for a stroll, or finding inspiration while just flicking through a magazine.ServiceNow gives you the power to make work, work better \u2013 no matter the circumstances.

    "articles": "Joe Biden reiterated that he hoped to work with Republicans to deliver coronavirus relief, but he made it clear that he would move forward with or without their support.\u201cThat\u2019s my preference to work together,\u201d the president said. \u201cBut they\u2019re just not willing to go as far as I think we have to go.\u201dBiden said that if he must decide between working with Republicans and quickly delivering financial relief to American families, the choice is clear.\u201cThat\u2019s an easy choice: I\u2019m going to help the American people who are hurting now,\u201d Biden said.Joe Biden is now delivering remarks on the economy and the need for more coronavirus relief at the White House.The president pointed to this morning\u2019s grim jobs report, which showed the US economy added just 49,000 jobs last month, to make the argument for more financial relief.\u201cIt\u2019s very clear our economy is still in trouble,\u201d Biden said.The president\u2019s remarks come hours after the Senate passed the Democratic budget resolution, clearing the way for Congress to approve Biden\u2019s relief package without Republican support.Jim Clyburn, the House majority whip, said Democrats were open to more targeted aid when it comes to the $1,400 direct payments in Joe Biden\u2019s coronavirus relief package.\u201cWe believe that it should go to the people who need it most,\u201d Clyburn said of the relief checks.WATCH NOW: House Democrats speak to reporters after meeting with President Biden about COVID relief https://t.co/Nj065CIsxp pic.twitter.com/07QT9IGjF5The White House has also said it is open to lowering the income eligibility level for receiving a $1,400 check.As of now, Biden\u2019s plan calls for phasing out the $1,400 checks for individuals who make more than $75,000 a year.House Democratic leaders and committee chairs have emerged from their White House meeting with Joe Biden.Speaking to reporters, House speaker Nancy Pelosi said she wanted the chamber to send a coronavirus relief package to the Senate in two weeks.The Democratic speaker indicated the reconciliation bill would be introduced in the House on Monday, and she said she hopes that it will attract bipartisan support.The message from Democrats is clear: they would like some Republicans to support the relief bill, but they are very willing to go it alone if bipartisanship seems out of reach.The Guardian\u2019s Ankita Rao reports:The US recorded more than 5,000 Covid-19 deaths on Thursday.The surge, the highest number to date, seems to be largely due to a backlog of data that was just released from Indiana, adding 1,500 deaths to the countrywide number, according to the Wall Street Journal. Though cases have otherwise been slowing down, the death toll is often a reflection of what happened in the weeks prior, since it\u2019s usually a lagging indicator of the virus spread. Yesterday, there were 5,077 US deaths in total, according to John Hopkins University data, and 122,473 new cases.Southern California and Arizona remain hotspots in the country, though the California governor, Gavin Newsom, has been easing restrictions in recent days, including the return of outdoor dining. Meanwhile, the vaccine rollout has been trudging along, with about 1.3m shots being administered every day, shy of Joe Biden\u2019s goal of 1.5m jabs daily.Dr Rochelle Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said the agency will be releasing guidance on safely reopening schools \u201cin the week ahead\u201d. Earlier this week, Walensky said schools could safely reopen before all teachers received coronavirus vaccines. But the White House later walked that back, saying Walensky\u2019s comments should be not treated as the official guidance of the CDC.The conversation about vaccinating teachers comes as some teachers\u2019 unions have threatened to strike if their members are asked to return to schools before being vaccinated.The White House coronavirus response team\u2019s briefing has now concluded.A reporter asked whether the White House coronavirus response team has already seen any benefit from Joe Biden\u2019s order asking Americans to wear masks for the first 100 days of his presidency.Dr Rochelle Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said it was still too early to draw any conclusions about the impact of the order.But Walensky added that initial studies in 10 states indicated that coronavirus hospitalization rates went down after three weeks of the mask order.The Defense Production Act will be invoked to help Pfizer obtain equipment to meet its vaccine production targets, the White House pandemic response team announced.The DPA is a law allowing the president to compel companies to manufacture certain products to address urgent national needs.Tim Manning, the pandemic response team supply coordinator, also said that 61 million at-home coronavirus tests will be available to Americans by the end of summer. The White House coronavirus response team is now holding a briefing to provide an update on vaccine distribution.Andy Slavitt, a senior White House adviser on the pandemic response, announced that the defense department has approved sending more than 1,000 active-duty personnel to support vaccine distribution. The troops\u2019 efforts will start in California, where two mass vaccination sites are now opening in Los Angeles and Oakland.Slavitt also announced that six companies will help expand production of at-home coronavirus tests, with the goal of having \u201cmillions\u201d of tests available by the summer.Earlier this week, the pandemic response team announced a partnership with the healthcare company Ellume, which has produced the first at-home, over-the counter coronavirus test.Democrats are pointing to this morning\u2019s grim jobs report to make the case for Joe Biden\u2019s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package.\u201cThe latest jobs report is another confirmation that Americans need relief now\u2014and that\u2019s why Senate Democrats took a big first step toward passing a historic COVID relief package early this morning, with Vice President Kamala Harris casting the deciding vote,\u201d Jaime Harrison, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said in a statement.\u201cDemocrats are delivering on our promises: relief checks that will put more money directly in Americans\u2019 pockets, help for small businesses and individuals who have lost their jobs or gotten sick during this pandemic, funding for local governments to speed up vaccinations and increase testing, and so much more,\u201d Harrison added. \u201cThis is leadership. This is what Americans voted for in November.\u201dThe Senate approved the Democratic budget resolution early this morning, paving the way to pass Biden\u2019s relief package without Republican support.",

    "articles": "\u201cA few years ago I read about an ill-disciplined team that everybody else in the league refused to play, thus giving them a run of walkover victories. As a result they were promoted and no longer a problem for that division. Any idea who this was?\u201d asks Chris Davis.The anti-heroes of this stranger-than-fiction story are Canelas 2010, who escaped the Portuguese fourth tier with the help of umpteen forfeits during the 2016-17 season. Canelas won six of their first seven games in their regional league, Porto Divis\u00e3o de Elite S\u00e9rie 1. Then, after a series of secret meetings, 12 of the other 13 teams said they would no longer play them. \u201cThey were reported for intimidating opponents,\u201d writes Nicholas Reid. \u201cSome players in the team were apparently members of an FC Porto ultras group.\u201dNot just members. The captain, Fernando Madureira, was leader of the Super Dragons \u2013 reportedly the most feared of the Porto ultras.A YouTube video of Canelas\u2019s zealous approach started to do the rounds, and the story even made the New York Times. The exception to the boycott was CD Candal, who were brave enough not only to play Canelas but beat them 2-0. They further confounded expectations by being the only team to have a player sent off in the game.That was Canelas\u2019s only regular-season defeat. Sixteen of their 24 wins were by walkover, and they finished 25 points ahead of second-placed Rio Tinto. Both went into a six-team mini-league to decide promotion to the third-tier national league.With promotion at stake, the other teams decided to play Canelas. (The last two games of their regular season had also taken place.) In the third game, against Rio Tinto, Marco Gon\u00e7alves was sent off in the second minute for chinning an opponent off the ball and then arrested for breaking the referee\u2019s nose by kneeing him in the face.Gon\u00e7alves took Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s old excuse to a new level by saying he couldn\u2019t remember the incident. He was sacked by Canelas and banned from football for four and a half years. The official breakdown of the ban was \u201cfour years for assaulting a referee, two months for insults and threats, and three months for assaulting an opposition player\u201d. He later received an 11-month jail sentence, suspended for two years.The match was abandoned, with Rio Tinto given a 3-0 win. They boycotted the return game six weeks later, a decision that ultimately meant Canelas were promoted ahead of them. That, as far as we\u2019re aware, was the last of the walkovers. Canelas only lasted a season in the third tier before being relegated, but they were promoted again in the 2018-19 season and are currently in the third tier, top of Campeonato de Portugal S\u00e9rie D.\u201cNewport v Brighton ended at 10.30pm on a Sunday recently, surely the latest a match has ever ended on that day,\u201d tweets Steve Williams. \u201cBut what\u2019s the latest in the evening a domestic match in the UK has ever finished?\u201dWe\u2019ve gone over early kick-offs before (Barcelona v Sevilla, 12.05am was late but technically edged it), but several can beat this \u2026 albeit not on a Sunday. \u201cI was at West Ham in 2015, for the FA Cup tie that Everton lost after extra-time and 21 penalties,\u201d recalls Martin Doyle. A hunt through the archives has the decisive penalty scored at 10.34pm.On Twitter, @rezahardy offers \u201cLiverpool\u2019s 4-3 League Cup win at Aston Villa on 18 December 2002, when the usual 7.45pm kick-off was delayed due to crowd congestion until 9.05pm so the match finished at nearly 11pm. Thankfully Danny Murphy scored a 90th-minute goal or it would have gone into extra-time.\u201dBut we can go later, albeit in non-league. \u201cHow about 11.16pm, for Leamington\u2019s 3-0 win against eight-man Kettering, er, last Tuesday?\u201d suggests Robin Tucker. \u201cWhat\u2019s more, the game didn\u2019t even go to extra-time, it was delayed by floodlight failure.\u201d The full-time whistle came at the mentioned time, rather than the later claim in their highlights package.3\ufe0f\u20e3 3 goals\u2604\ufe0f Goal direct from a corner\ud83d\udd34 3 red cards\ud83c\udf2a Storm Christoph\u274c Floodlight failure\ud83d\udd70 Final whistle at 11:30pmHighlights of our crazy win against @KTFCOfficial are now on @LeamingtonFCTV! Highlights: https://t.co/GNavkpKDYU pic.twitter.com/mu3a2TDfGgWorthy of mention too is this from Jason Jandu. \u201cIn October 1996, an under-21 international between England and Poland at Molineux was delayed until 10pm after a suspect package was found and neutralised,\u201d he mails, \u201cso the match must have gone on until at least 11.45pm.\u201d\u201cThe record attendance at the old Malm\u00f6 Stadion was set in the first match it hosted, Argentina v West Germany in the 1958 World Cup,\u201d tweets Adam. \u201cAre there any other grounds that either never bettered their first attendance or set their record in a match between two sides not from their country?\u201dThere are a few examples, one of them close to home. \u201cThe obvious answer is the old Wembley,\u201d writes Paul Quinton (and others). \u201cThe first event there was the 1923 FA Cup final between Bolton and West Ham. In their wisdom, the FA reasoned that nothing like the then-official capacity of 127,000 would turn up, so it didn\u2019t make it all-ticket. The official attendance was given as 126,047, but some estimates of how many got in vary between 200,000 and 300,000. It wasn\u2019t long before finals were made all-ticket and the capacity was restricted to 100,000.\u201dThe same goes for Sydney\u2019s Olympic Stadium. \u201cThe highest attendance of 104,098 occurred at the first official game, the 2000 final between Cameroon and Spain,\u201d writes Sam Hill. \u201cAfter the Olympics, the north and south stands were removed and the capacity reduced, so the number can\u2019t be broken.\u201dAnd finally to Florida. \u201cOrlando Pride, of the NWSL, set their still-standing record of 23,403 at their first match, in April 2016 at Camping World Stadium,\u201d notes Dave Mellinger. \u201cIn fact, that was the league attendance record until it was eclipsed in 2019 by the Portland Thorns in their newly-enlarged stadium.\u201d\u201cHas there ever been the Saturday night score announcer\u2019s all-time dream result: East Fife 5-4 Forfar?\u201d wrote Hugh McGinley back in 2004.Nearly but not quite, although we possibly prefer what happened. The Fifers visited Station Park during the 1963-64 campaign in the old Scottish Second Division and scored four. Their hosts still won, the final score being \u2026 Forfar 5-4 East Fife. In October 2011, East Fife won a thriller, but only 4-3. Then in July 2018, Forfar won 5-4 again \u2026 in a penalty shootout, after a 1-1 draw in the Scottish League Cup.@TheKnowledge_GU Chelsea\u2019s statement sacking Mourinho was 16 words (from @FootballCliches) - what\u2019s the shortest ever?Post-Lampard sacking - longest serving managers who had a playing career at the club?\u201cWhen reading about two of my passions, football and heraldry (yes, really), I came across a 2015 article in which the York Herald from the College of Arms encouraged English clubs to register their badges and said some might be acting unlawfully otherwise,\u201d mails Rich Booth. \u201cHas any club since registered a badge as a heraldic device, or been penalised for not doing so?\u201dJermain Defoe will be a few months shy of 39 years old in May, when Rangers could potentially be crowned Scottish champions. Has a player ever been older when winning their first ever league title?@TheKnowledge_GU this may have done before but seeing as the Man City game tonight had to be stopped because of fireworks going off next door, what\u2019s the strangest reason for a game being paused/abandoned?Gareth Bale's last 6 goals for club and country have come in 6 different competitions. Is this a record?\u201cThis sounds like boasting from a Rams fan, but Derby\u2019s last three managers (Frank Lampard, Philip Cocu, Wayne Rooney) have a combined total of more than 320 international caps,\u201d boasts Rob James. \u201cCan any other team (club or international) in men\u2019s or women\u2019s football claim to have such a decorated succession of gaffers?\u201dHas any footballer been booked or sent off for a provocative or over-the-top manner of scoring a goal (like stopping the ball on the line and nudging in with their head)?Federico Valverde was awarded the Supercopa\u2019s man of the match, after being sent off for his mesmerising professional foul. But have any players been sent off, scored own goals or committed other misc calamities AFTER being named man of the match? https://t.co/hHSHqHdG3G\u2022 Email your questions and answers to knowledge@theguardian.com or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU.",

    "articles": "\u201cHas any footballer been booked or sent off for scoring a goal in a provocative or over-the-top manner (like stopping the ball on the line and nudging it in with their head)?\u201d wonders Ronan Brennan.Well, goals bring joy so why not add some decorative detail once in a while. Football is about forging memories, not just filling a history book with scorelines. Can anyone remember Rangers beating Ayr in the 2000 Scottish Cup semi-final? Nope. But we do recall the moment in that game when Andrei Kanchelskis stood on the ball before impudently raising his hand to his head to survey the penalty area. The ultimate showboat probably has to involve a goal, though, so let us begin these examples of embellishment that came with no fear of reprisal.This happened as recently as last December. \u201cSilas Wamangituka from VfB Stuttgart was booked for unsportsmanlike conduct after holding the ball on the line before scoring against Bremen, triggering much discussion in the German media,\u201d writes Mark Jameson.VfB Stuttgart's Silas Wamangituka with the savage goal of the year.Is it cheeky, or disrespectful? \ud83e\udd14https://t.co/4xiF5RlSJJ#BundesligaDiMolaTV pic.twitter.com/JmoAixBMVU\u201cAs it transpired, the great Karl-Heinz Rummenigge topped it with this cheek against Club Brugge during a pre-season tournament e in 1981.\u201dRummenigge scooped the ball up and headed it over the line to put Bayern 4-0 up in a match they eventually won 5-1. Like Wamangituka, Rummenigge was booked. Unlike Wamangituka, his effort won Goal of the Month. Yep, really.A easy goal for Karl-Heinz RUMMENIGGE (Vs Club Brugge in 1981) pic.twitter.com/86kKuKGu8ANot all referees whip out the yellow card in such situations. As far as we can tell, Patrick Kluivert was not punished for taking his time to score during the Netherlands\u2019 5-5 draw with Belgium, in 1999; nor was Paul-Georges Ntep of Rennes when he went down on all fours to head the ball over the line against Reims in 2014. But Ntep was substituted by his manager, Philippe Montainer, who later said he made the change because Ntep disrespected the opposition team.Meanwhile, Guffen Helleve has, well, a helluva story from Norway. \u201cIn a Norwegian Cup match against Mo in 1987, Bod\u00f8/Glimt\u2019s Mini Jakobsen dribbled past two defenders and the keeper, stopped the ball on the goalline and nudged it in with his head,\u201d writes Guffen. \u201cThe referee was not amused, and although he didn\u2019t book Jakobsen, he did disallow the goal for unsportsmanlike behaviour.\u201d\u201cCameroon international goalkeeper Fabrice Ondoa, 25, has played 44 times for his country, yet has only made a total of 38 league appearances,\u201d writes Alex Blackburne. \u201cIs there anyone else who has more international caps  than domestic outings?\u201dDan Robinson begins the search for anomalies with this. \u201cOne name that came straight to mind is Louie Annesley, a young defender at Blackburn. He is yet to make a league appearance for his club, and has only made three career league appearances at a senior professional level to date (while with Lincoln Red Imps in Gibraltar). Despite this, he already has 15 caps for the senior Gibraltar national team.\u201dAnd here\u2019s a right royal tale from Anubhav Dasgupta. \u201cThe one that jumps to mind here is Faiq Bolkiah. Probably the richest footballer in the world, Bolkiah is the nephew of Brunei\u2019s Sultan. He has never played a senior league game in his career, yet he has six appearances for the Brunei national team, even scoring once against Laos!\u201dAnd you thought Messi or Ronaldo topped soccer\u2019s rich list. Bolkiah had a youth career at Arsenal, Chelsea and Leicester and, despite not playing once, was apparently on the books at the King Power from 2016-20 apparently. \u201cWith Tom Cairney not getting game time, Joachim Andersen is currently captaining Fulham,\u201d writes Jim Miles. \u201cHas there ever been an occasion where a loanee was the full-time captain?\u201dPaul Moran provides a very recent example. \u201cSead Kolasinac has been made vice-captain on his loan return to Schalke this month, but due to an injury to the captain, Omar Mascarell, Kola has been the captain for each of his first three Bundesliga games.\u201dThere\u2019s more. \u201cAt PSV Eindhoven, Marco van Ginkel (on loan from Chelsea) was the captain in 2017-18,\u201d recalls Stephan Wijnen. \u201cAnd not only that: at the end of the season he lifted the championship trophy!\u201d\u201cAfter Roma\u2019s debacle, has any team ever lost a match by default after making too many substitutions before?\u201d tweets @partsublimated.Unfortunately, there are others who went to the Graham Poll school of counting.\u201cIt happened in the Bundesliga before, the 1998-99 season,\u201d remembers Ulrich Denzer. \u201cNewly promoted Kaiserslautern were hosting Bochum when Michael Schjonberg had to be taken off due to injury. Coach Otto Rehhagel substituted Pascal Ojigwe, who did not have a European pass at the time, making him ineligible due to the league\u2019s statutes (as each club was only allowed to field a certain number of such players). When Rehhagel noticed the error, he tried to correct it by having Hani Ramzi fake an injury. To no avail. The league commission ended up awarding the game to Bochum.\u201d\u201cHave they ever used an actual hat for the FA Cup draw?\u201d asked Andy Morrison in 2006. \u201cIf so, when was it last used, and what kind of hat was it?\u201dEarly draws really did involve headwear; a top hat covered by a handkerchief, to be precise. It was filled with pieces of paper bearing the names of the clubs, with a member of the FA committee delicately lifting a corner of the handkerchief to draw the ties. Bryon Butler\u2019s history of the competition is the only source of information on this arcane ritual, as until the first radio coverage of the draw in December 1935 it was \u201cbarred and bolted against all unofficial comers\u201d \u2013 including the press. By then, the bag and ball arrangement was in place. Indeed, the then FA secretary, Sir Stanley Rous, was asked by the BBC to rattle the balls in the bag for dramatic effect.David Barber, the FA\u2019s historian, suggests that the top hat and handkerchief met their demise in a drive for modernisation around 1914. Nevertheless, phrases such as \u201cin the hat for the next round\u201d will always have their roots in the actual routine of the draw.\u201cWhich football clubs have been sponsored by news organisations and have they ever played a game against another team, also sponsored by a news organisation?\u201d ponders Rich Cunningham. \u201cOr has there ever been a sort of old media v new? Newspaper v TV, or similar?\u201dQuestion for @TheKnowledge_GU and it might be hard to answer. What is the longest a tv football commentator (or commentary team) has gone without uttering a single word during a live match broadcast?\u201cAll 16 FA Cup fourth-round ties were settled in 90 minutes. Has this ever happened before?\u201d wonders Mitchell Sandler.Whilst researching the Portugese Primeira Liga during a Football Manager save, I saw the 1946/47 season averaged an astonishing 933 goals in 182 matches (5.13 per match). Even Estoril in 5th scored 96 goals in 26 games! Is this goals-per-match a record, major league or otherwise?\u201cCan you find out why the thrilling 1962 European Cup final was not televised in the UK?\u201d asks Michael Potts. \u201cI seem to remember something about a strike. Is it the only European Cup final not to be seen live in the UK?\u201dWhat\u2019s the most penalties saved by a goalkeeper in one season (not incl shootout saves)? Neil Sullivan saved at least four for Leeds in 2004-05 and Willy Gueret at least four for MK Dons in 2007-08 (in all competitions), but not sure if they or indeed anyone else has saved more?\u201cSome years ago I remember seeing a clip of a match where a fan ran on the pitch from near the goal and kicked the ball,\u201d writes Eddy Reynolds. \u201cIt may have been at Old Trafford in the 1970s at the Stretford End. Anyone know any more?\u201d\u2022 Email your questions and answers to knowledge@theguardian.com or tweet @TheKnowledge_GU.",

    "articles": "Bronze age graves, neolithic pottery and the vestiges of a mysterious C-shaped enclosure that might have been a prehistoric industrial area are among the finds unearthed by archaeologists who have carried out preliminary work on the site of the proposed new road tunnel at Stonehenge.One of the most intriguing discoveries is a unique shale object that could have been part of a staff or club found in a 4,000-year-old grave. Nearby is the resting spot of a baby buried with a small, plain beaker.Ditches that flank the C-shaped enclosure contain burnt flint, suggesting a process such as metal or leatherworking was carried out there thousands of years ago.Just south of the site of the Stonehenge visitor centre, archaeologists came upon neolithic grooved ware pottery possibly left there by the people who built the stone circle or visited it.\u201cWe\u2019ve found a lot \u2013 evidence about the people who lived in this landscape over millennia, traces of people\u2019s everyday lives and deaths, intimate things,\u201d said Matt Leivers, A303 Stonehenge consultant archaeologist at Wessex Archaeology. \u201cEvery detail lets us work out what was happening in that landscape before during and after the building of Stonehenge. Every piece brings that picture into a little more focus.\u201dThe plan to drop the A303, which passes close to the stones, into a two-mile tunnel is hugely controversial, with many experts having said that carrying out such intrusive construction work would cause disastrous harm to one of the world\u2019s most precious ancient landscapes and lead to the loss of hundreds of thousands of artefacts. A legal challenge was launched against the \u00a31.7bn plan late last year.Highways England and Wessex Archaeology, which is leading the exploration of the tunnel corridor, said they were working on the project systematically and sensitively.During this preliminary phase, Wessex experts have hand dug and sieved almost 1,800 test pits and excavated and recorded more than 400 trial trenches.The next phase of archaeological excavations will begin later this year, lasting approximately 18 months and involving up to 150 archaeologists. Construction work on the tunnel is due to start in 2023.Near the planned eastern portal of the tunnel, the archaeologists discovered large amounts of debitage \u2013 waste material from the manufacture of flint tools \u2013 and ditches that may date to the iron age and could be associated with Vespasian\u2019s Camp, a hillfort to the south.Close to the western end, two burials of Beaker people, who arrived in Britain in about 2,500BC, were found. One was an adult, buried in a crouched position with a pot or beaker. Also in the grave was a copper awl or fragment of a pin or needle and a small shale cylindrical object, of a type that is not believed to have been found before.\u201cIt is an oddity,\u201d said Leivers. More detailed work will be carried out to find out what it is, but one theory is that it could be the tip of a ceremonial wooden staff or mace.Also found in the same area was a pit dating to the age of the Beaker people containing the tiny ear bones of a child and a very simple pot \u2013 a sign that this too was a grave. Usually Beaker pots are ornate but this one is plain, probably to reflect the age of the person who diedA little farther south, the C-shaped enclosure was found. \u201cIt is a strange pattern of ditches,\u201d said Leivers. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to say what it was, but we know how old it is because we found a near-complete bronze age pot in one of the ditches.\u201dAlso in the ditches was a large quantity of burnt flint. \u201cThis suggests there may have had some industrial function,\u201d said Leivers. \u201cIt could be metal or leatherworking, pottery manufacture, crop processing.\u201dAnother find was a group of objects dating to the late neolithic period \u2013 when the stone circle was built \u2013 including grooved ware pottery, a flint and red deer antlers.For the time being the finds are in storage in Salisbury and will ultimately go on display in the city\u2019s museum.The team accepts that all road schemes have an impact on an area\u2019s archaeology. Andy Crockett, A303 project director for Wessex Archaeology, said: \u201cThere isn\u2019t one option that would allow zero impact on archaeological remains; that\u2019s true of every development you can think of.\u201dHe said the trade-off was that the sight of cars and lorries trundling along the A303 close to the stones would vanish and two halves of the world heritage site now split by the road would be reunited.Highways England said the amount of survey work that had been carried out was unprecedented because of the significance of the site. David Bullock, A303 project manager for Highways England, said: \u201cThere has been a huge amount of investigations so that this route can be threaded through so as to disturb as little as possible.\u201d",

    "articles": "By now it is almost received wisdom that \u201cpopulists\u201d (often used as a euphemism for \u201cthe far right\u201d) have ignored the threat of Covid-19, that populists have been the electoral victims of the pandemic, and that the pandemic has exposed the political incompetence of populists in government.Most of this speculation is based on one or two individual cases, most notably the US president, Donald Trump. But he is the exception rather than the rule. In a recent comparative study of far-right parties in the European Union, we found that none of those three assumptions holds up to scrutiny. In fact, there has been significant variety in far-right responses to the pandemic.In contrast to Trump, most European far-right parties were quick to point to the danger of the virus to the point of outright alarmism, although many started to walk that back after the number of cases had peaked, and some even started to spread misinformation. Matteo Salvini and his League party in Italy saw the virus as a major threat, but with time opinions on Covid started to fluctuate. The main reason was that the most affected regions in Italy were governed by the League. Consequently, the party went from Salvini\u2019s alarmist appeals to close the borders and ban the Chinese new year, to claims that the virus was not that bad by the League governor of the hardest-hit province, Lombardy.Many far-right parties in opposition initially criticised their governments for responding too slowly, but quickly became the loudest critics of the alleged \u201canti-democratic\u201d and \u201cunconstitutional\u201d government policies when lockdowns were introduced. For instance, the Alternative for Germany (AfD) argued that freedom of speech was \u201cthe clearest victim of corona\u201d, while the Austrian Freedom party (FP\u00d6) claimed that it had stopped \u201ctotalitarian\u201d surveillance plans.By contrast, far-right parties in government implicated the opposition in spreading the virus or frustrating the national response. For instance, the Hungarian government targeted the mayor of Budapest for mismanaging the situation, while Polish prime minister Mateusz Morawiecki argued that the opposition, \u201cinstead of taking care of peace and helping, threw sand in the modes\u201d.The second misperception is that far-right parties have been the big losers of the pandemic \u2013 recently strengthened by the claim that Trump lost the election because of Covid-19. However, in our study of 31 far-right parties in EU member states, only half lost some support in the first, more acute, coronavirus wave, from mid-March to mid-June. Of the rest, five gained support, and 10 experienced no change in the polls. Moreover, the overall effect was marginal, within 1% on average. Far-right parties have started to lose a bit more during the continuing second wave, although the averages remain small and within the polls\u2019 margin of error.Once again, government status seems to play a role. The far-right parties in control in Hungary and Poland mostly gained in the first wave but lost the most in the second wave. Far-right parties in governing coalitions were initially not affected but have now seen some small losses. And far-right parties in opposition, the vast majority, experienced some small losses in the first wave that have largely disappeared in the second wave.So, did the pandemic expose \u201cthe incompetence\u201d of the far right in power? The European data provides little evidence for this. Countries with far-right governments adopted the strictest measures of all; and while those with far-right parties in coalition took less severe measures, it is hard to assess those parties\u2019 roles. And in terms of cases and deaths per population, the numbers are mostly lower for countries with far-right parties in government or in coalition than for countries where the far right is in opposition.It should be noted that all the countries with far-right government participation are in central and eastern Europe, the region least hit by Covid-19 in the first wave. Still, even here countries with far-right parties in government did slightly better than other countries in the region.In short, much of the public debate about the far right, populism and Covid-19 is wrong. Overall, the far right has not ignored Covid-19, has not been its electoral victim, and has not been exposed as incompetent by the pandemic. While the far right has generally framed Covid-19 and the pandemic in line with its ideology (nativism, authoritarianism, and populism), its policy responses have differed, mainly based on whether they are in government or opposition.More than anything, these findings show that we should stop viewing the European far right through the prism of Trump. The US president is in many ways the exception rather than the rule in terms of far-right politics. And as Trump leaves the White House, far-right parties remain major players in Europe.\u2022 Cas Mudde is Stanley Wade Shelton UGAF professor of international affairs at the University of Georgia; Jakub Wondreys is a PhD student specialising in European politics at the University of Georgia",

    "articles": "Ioannina is no Mykonos. A city on the northern Greek mainland near the border with Albania, it is landlocked and rarely on any tourist trail. As far as guidebook mentions go, it\u2019s silverwork, feta cheese and local spring water.But back in spring 1994 it burst on to front pages across Europe, seizing the minds of politicians. Ioannina joined the ranks of little-known European cities to host a European summit and become a household name for a fortnight.From Messina to Maastricht, such places will fill history books of the future as they retrace the story of European integration \u2013 and Britain\u2019s troubled joining and departure.In March 1994, Europe\u2019s foreign ministers, meeting in Ioannina, were arguing about power and who really gets to wield it. The debate was all about the EU\u2019s smaller countries \u201ctaking back control\u201d. The result \u2013 the Ioannina compromise \u2013 was a seemingly arcane technical bargain about voting rights in an enlarged EU, but it paved the way for fewer national vetoes and deeper European integration.Ten years earlier, in June 1985, it was Schengen \u2013 not even a town or city, but a Luxembourg village \u2013 that was on everyone\u2019s lips.With a population of fewer than 5,000, and previously known only for its wine-making, it is close to where the territories of Germany, France and Luxembourg meet. A number of European nations met there to sign the momentous Schengen agreement \u2013 a milestone in Europe\u2019s integration, which abolished border controls over much of Europe.And though most people think it started in 1957 with the Treaty of Rome \u2013 rich with imperial symbolism, surely \u2013 the key breakthrough actually came a few years before, in the more obscure city of Messina, the third-largest on the island of Sicily.Messina kicked off the whole EEC project. However, the British famously didn\u2019t go. Old Foreign Office hands reminisced that was it was \u201ctoo outlandish and far away\u201d to send a UK government representative.Forty years later and over 1,000 miles north, it was another \u201cm\u201d that unexpectedly took centre stage.In the student-filled but quiet medieval town of Maastricht, on the banks of the River Meuse in the Netherlands, European leaders took the huge twin strides of creating the euro and launching a European political union \u2013 creating the treaty that took the city\u2019s name.Imagine how the UK tabloids would have coped if the meeting had been in Berlin.The journey of subsequent European treaties snaked across Europe in a winding path worthy of any student\u2019s interrail ticket \u2013 from Amsterdam to Nice to Lisbon \u2013 each stop a step on the way to more European integration.But these places are synonymous not only with leaps forward in the European project, but also rising arguments over it, as Britain fell more and more deeply out of love with the EU.Dublin \u2013 one of Europe\u2019s smaller capitals \u2013 witnessed one of Britain\u2019s most momentous rows with European leaders. The acrimonious summit held there was Margaret Thatcher\u2019s first, and was dominated by her demands for her money back. As Helmut Schmidt, the then German chancellor, quipped: she had hardly spent a penny and she wanted her pennies back.The row simmered through summit after summit until it was finally defused five years later at Fontainebleau.But perhaps the most poignant is another small French town with an impressive chateau, traditionally the summer residence of French presidents. Britain\u2019s uncomfortable relationship with Europe is symbolised by the rebuff at Rambouillet.In December 1962, the then British prime minister, Harold Macmillan, was doggedly fighting to get Britain into the European club against resistance from the French leader, General De Gaulle.Meeting at Rambouillet\u2019s chateau, Macmillan was bluntly let down by his French counterpart. Realising his plans to get Britain into the EEC were in ruins, Macmillan reportedly left the town in tears, leaving Britain to wait another 10 years.Security concerns and growing workloads mean that more and more meetings are held in Brussels. But the crisscrossing journey to obscure European backwaters will continue without the UK. The decisive meetings on Europe\u2019s future won\u2019t be hosted by Carlisle, Leicester or any other UK town \u2013 but they could be in Belgrade or Minsk.\u2022 This article was amended on 5 January 2021. Schengen is located near to where Germany, France and Luxembourg meet, rather than Belgium, France and Luxembourg as a previous version said.Nigel Gardner is a former European commission spokesman and produced the BBC\u2019s history of Britain\u2019s relationship with the EU.",

    "articles": "Black Lives Matter protests last summer sparked an uncomfortable reckoning for many European nations with a legacy of slavery and colonialism.Excavating this dark history via revised school curriculums and initiatives such as Black History Month is difficult. But it is badly needed, and not just to dispel the self-congratulatory and entirely false narratives about Europe\u2019s \u201ccivilisational\u201d past still being driven by nationalist and populist politicians.The new conversation is urgently required if the EU is to salvage flagging efforts to launch a so-called partnership of equals with African nations. And it is needed, too, if European governments are to put relations with African European citizens on a sounder and more respectful footing.There are encouraging signs. In Germany, BLM protests injected momentum into efforts to change street names with colonial-era or racist references. In France, the armed forces ministry provided local authorities with a guide to 100 Africans who fought for France in the second world war, so that streets and squares may be named after them. President Macron had, in 2019 during a visit to Ivory Coast, denounced the French \u201chegemonic view and the trappings of colonialism\u201d, which he said were \u201ca grave mistake \u2013 a fault of the republic\u201d.In Belgium, authorities responded to protests by removing at least some public monuments to King Leopold II, whose forces seized Congo in the late 19th century and ran an exploitative regime that led to the deaths of millions.And in an unprecedented step last summer, Belgium\u2019s King Philippe, an indirect descendent of Leopold II, wrote to the Congolese president, F\u00e9lix Tshisekedi, to offer his deepest regret for the \u201chumiliation and suffering\u201d inflicted during Belgium\u2019s colonial occupation of the country. The pain of the past, said the king, was \u201crevived by the discrimination that is still all too present in our societies\u201d.They may have been a long time coming, and carry only symbolic value, but such gestures matter.Macron\u2019s recent decision to invite young Africans rather than their political leaders to a France-Africa summit on biodiversity in July and to involve African Europeans in the effort are also steps in the right direction; as are efforts to bring female entrepreneurs, cities and business leaders into continuing African-European conversations.Because Europe and Africa are interconnected and interdependent. They need each other to create jobs and growth on both continents, to ensure a post-pandemic economic recovery and to tackle climate change.The EU remains the leading aid, trade and investment actor across the continent. African exports of raw materials, chemicals and petroleum products, minerals and metals as well as fishery and agricultural goods, continue to be the mainstay of many European industries.Yet, even if Africa\u2019s once dynamic growth rates have been slowed by the pandemic, its economic potential, youthful population and plans to build an African Continental Free Area, (AfCFTA) modelled on the EU single market, will intensify international rivalry and competition \u2013 especially between Europe and China.EU policymakers insist that their policies are better than Beijing\u2019s, and that while China\u2019s investments under the belt and road initiative grab global attention, they are worsening Africa\u2019s already high debt burden and making debt-relief measures even more urgent.African commentators accuse the EU, which makes its aid conditional on human rights and other norms, of harbouring \u201cpaternalistic\u201d attitudes, saying the bloc could learn from Beijing on consulting, informing and working with African states as true equals. They have a point.African Union leaders cancelled a much-trailed online EU-Africa mini-summit in early December at the last minute. That followed the postponement because of coronavirus of a full-format meeting scheduled for October. This can not be brushed off as just another routine diplomatic mishap.It is time to come clean. A reset of this relationship is difficult because many increasingly self-confident Africans are understandably sceptical about Europe\u2019s motives. Africa-Europe relations have for years been marked by an imbalanced donor/recipient relationship, with African governments seeking access to EU trade and aid preferences, while European leaders have cultivated privileged ties with African elites and ignored the needs of the continent\u2019s younger generation. Fortress Europe\u2019s aim to keep out African migrants has added to the mistrust.Tasked with picking up the pieces, Portugal, as current holder of the rotating EU presidency, is hoping it can replicate this year a successful EU-Africa summit it organised in 2007.But times have changed. Geopolitics have become more unpredictable, the uncertainties triggered by the pandemic are countless and more countries, including post-Brexit Britain, are vying with the EU for economic opportunities in Africa.One way forward would be an EU acknowledgment of the damage wreaked by colonialism followed by a recognition by African governments that a new generation of modern European leaders \u2013 as EU council President Charles Michel noted last year \u2013 can no longer be weighed down by the \u201cburden of nostalgia\u201d.A joint statement that admits the missteps of the past but also promises fresh beginnings may not lead to an immediate uptick in EU-Africa relations. But it would represent a very good start.If they are to make good on plans for a fairer revamp of relations with African states, EU leaders must take collective action to exorcise the ghosts of Leopold II \u2013 and those of other colonial \u201cheroes\u201d who trod similar ground.That will mean addressing African grievances over Europe\u2019s role in the slave trade and the crueller aspects of colonial rule, as well as persistent modern-day discrimination, racism and unconscious bias.It will require a change in Europe\u2019s toxic debate on migration, implementation of a new EU anti-racism agenda and stepping up work on \u201cinternational partnerships\u201d to replace the traditional EU policy of aid \u2013 or, as it was known in Brussels until recently, \u201cdevelopment cooperation\u201d, in which outdated white saviour narratives were firmly embedded.Shada Islam is a Brussels-based commentator on EU affairs.

    "articles": "\u201cI am happy to work on the frontline and to see the Canadian medical system function so well,\u201d Alecu M\u0103tr\u0103gun\u0103 wrote in a Facebook post, \u201cbut I am sad that I was vaccinated before my mother, who works in the medical system in Moldova.\u201d M\u0103tr\u0103gun\u0103 is a Moldovan sonographer living in Montreal. His mother is 61 and a paediatrician with more than 30 years\u2019 service under her belt. Yet, he told me, she has no idea when the Covid-19 vaccine might become available for her and for more than 53,300 other healthcare staff in Europe\u2019s poorest country.I had a similar reaction to M\u0103tr\u0103gun\u0103\u2019s about my family in Moldova when I saw a sign at my local London pharmacy as long ago as early December, announcing that the vaccine was on its way. At the time, my grandmother had just recovered and my father was still battling with the effects of the virus.Most western European governments have already vaccinated frontline workers and are moving into the second phase of their rollout, even if production problems are now undermining supplies. Moldova, Europe\u2019s poorest country, has not been able to deliver a single jab yet because it can\u2019t afford to buy the vaccine.The Moldovan government does not expect to receive its first batch of vaccine before the end of February, and even that timetable is uncertain and fraught with bureaucratic delays. Ukraine, Georgia and Armenia are in a similar predicament. This is what the \u201ccatastrophic moral failure\u201d over vaccine distribution, in the words of the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, looks like in Europe.Europe\u2019s most economically disadvantaged countries are relying on Covax, a facility for low-income nations led by WHO in response to the pandemic. The organisation will guarantee free jabs for 20% of a country\u2019s population. As for the rest of the doses they need, these countries are seeking help from richer neighbours. That is hardly the way to solve a global pandemic. In an interconnected world, no country is safe until every country is safe.I\u2019ve been home in Chi\u0219in\u0103u since December, and news of Covid-19 related deaths of family friends, former colleagues, or well-known personalities are a daily occurrence. Indeed, the overall death rate in Moldova rose by 21% between May and December 2020, compared with the same period in 2019.The healthcare system is overwhelmed. One man in his 60s, ill with the virus, had to wait for a free bed for three hours in the courtyard of the hospital in the cold. Last spring, videos of patients in smaller provincial hospitals showed shocking conditions, such as no heating or clean water. In one hospital, a man died in the toilet, and the staff, lacking protective equipment, were afraid to get close to him for hours. Eventually they asked other Covid-19 patients to take the body out and cover it with a blanket.With a population of 2.6 million, Moldova has had just under 157,000 official Covid-19 cases, and more than 3,300 deaths. Yet the real infection numbers are likely to be a lot higher, since the government has only tested between 1,000 and 3,000 people daily, reaching an astonishing rate of 58% positive tests in December. People with light symptoms are often refused tests for weeks. Frontline doctors working on Covid wards are the only medics who are tested. Moreover, while my father and grandmother have both been seriously ill with many of the typical Covid symptoms, their tests came back negative. They were only tested once.The infection rate among medical staff was 25% in May, the highest in Europe, compared with only 12% in neighbouring Romania.The pandemic has shed light on the severe underfunding and poor management of the former Soviet Republic\u2019s overstretched public health services. The longer term effects could prove catastrophic.M\u0103tr\u0103gun\u0103\u2019s case makes plain one of the Moldovan health system\u2019s most chronic ailments: a medical brain drain. Just under a third of healthcare workers are of retirement age. The average monthly salary of a GP is now about \u00a3430, following a 30% increase in 2020. In addition to limited funds, those remaining at home struggle with corruption and the politicisation of hospital management. Many seek better opportunities and fairer systems abroad. Without massive injections of funding and healthcare modernisation,Moldova\u2019s young medics will keep leaving for richer countries, while Moldovans at home will end up with even more substandardprovision.Mass emigration isn\u2019t just a problem for Moldova\u2019s health system: it is probably the country\u2019s biggest challenge. Lacking job opportunities at home or looking for better standards of living in the west, Russia, or Israel, more than a million Moldovans \u2013 myself included \u2013 have left the country. Over the past year, tens of thousands of us who either lost jobs abroad due to lockdown restrictions or are privileged enough to be able to work remotely, have returned home. Yet this reverse migration might be temporary unless the government finally offers some economic support to its citizens.Masks are mandatory even on the streets, social distancing rules are in place and shops measure everyone\u2019s temperature, but not all people obey the government recommendations and vaccine scepticism is anecdotally high, even among health professionals. In surveys, people say they are more concerned with the economic rather than the health crisis: illness does not even make it into the five main worries Moldovans have \u2013 it is topped by the future of their children, high prices, poverty, unemployment and corruption.Throughout 2020, Moldova was one of the few European states that provided barely any financial relief to citizens or small businesses. The consequences could start to bite hard in 2021. Newly elected president Maia Sandu, a former World Bank economist, was inaugurated on Christmas Eve and secured promises from western partners including a donation of 200,000 vaccine doses from Romania and a \u20ac15m crisis grant from the EU.But Moldova\u2019s executive has since resigned, the government lacks a legitimate parliamentary majority and the political class is battling over how to organise snap parliamentary elections while also figuring out how to deliver a mass vaccination programme.The light at the end of our tunnel is not even in sight.Paula Erizanu is a Moldovan writer based in London",
